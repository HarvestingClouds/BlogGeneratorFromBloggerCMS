It means that you need to **plan and migrate** your resources from ASM portal to the ARM portal.\r\n\r\nThe key resource is your infrastructure which primarily consists of virtual machines. To migrate a single Virtual Machine (VM) from ASM portal to ARM portal you can leverage a set of PowerShell scripts called ASM2ARM.\r\nYou can download these scripts and check their description on [GitHub here on the **ASM2ARM** page](https:\/\/github.com\/fullscale180\/asm2arm). You can check the detailed instructions there too.\r\n\r\nTo plan this right now is very important as the transitioning to Azure Resource Manager model is already underway.

		"body": "**Partial Configurations** is a new feature in PowerShell 5.0 Desired State Configuration or DSC. It allows the configurations to be delivered in parts or fragments. These configurations can come from various sources.\r\nThe Local Configuration Manager or LCM on the target node puts these partial configurations from different sources together and after that apply the same as a single configuration.\r\n\r\nThis opens various possibilities for Enterprises to manage their infrastructure and designate the responsibility to various teams for a single node. The team expert in a particular field can focus on that feature without worrying about other features.\r\n\r\nYou can have partial configurations in following modes:\r\n\r\n 1. Push Mode\r\n 2. Pull Mode\r\n 3. Hybrid Mode (i.e. combination of Push and Pull)\r\n \r\n### Configuration for the PUSH Mode\r\n\r\nYou need to follow three steps to configure Partial configurations for the PUSH mode:\r\n\r\n - Configure the LCM, on the target node, to expect partial configurations\r\n - Push each partial configuration from different sources using **Publish-DSCConfiguration** cmdlet. Target node will automatically combine the partial configurations into single configuration.\r\n - Apply the configuration by calling the **Start-DSCConfiguration**cmdlet\r\n \r\n### Configuration for the PULL Mode\r\n\r\nThis is bit complex than the Push mode. In nutshell you only need couple of steps:\r\n\r\n - Configure the LCM, on the target node, to receive partial configurations but from PULL servers\r\n - Name and locate the configuration documents properly on the pull servers\r\n \r\nTo know more about DSC Partial configurations follow the below references:\r\n\r\n   - [Detailed Blog by AutomationNext with very valuable insights](https:\/\/automationnext.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/19\/powershell-desired-state-configuration-partial-configurations-without-configurationid\/)\r\n   - [Official MSDN Article](https:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/en-us\/powershell\/dsc\/partialconfigs)",

This solves a big pain point for all Azure developers.\r\nNow you will be able to develop and test your scripts right from the convenience of your laptop's local PowerShell ISE. \r\n\r\n### What you need to do\r\nAll you need to do is install the PowerShell Add-On using the below cmdlet:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nFind-Module AzureAutomationAuthoringToolkit | Install-Module -Scope CurrentUser\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen import the module using below cmdlet:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nImport-Module AzureAutomationAuthoringToolkit\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can configure the Add-On using a Configuration tab in the add-on and start getting your hands dirty. \r\n\r\n### Official Information from the Add-On Help\r\n\r\n#### Capabilities\r\n\r\n - Test runbooks on your local machine and in the Azure Automation service: \r\n - Store and edit Automation Assets locally \r\n - Use Automation Activities (Get-AutomationVariable, Get-AutomationPSCredential, etc) in local PowerShell scripts \r\n - Sync changes back to your Automation Account \r\n - Run test jobs in Automation and view results \r\n\r\n#### Notes\r\nAssets\r\n\r\n - Secret values (passwords, encrypted variables) are not downloaded automatically; they need to be set manually the first time the account is synced \r\n - Values that haven't been downloaded will be highlighted \r\n - Asset values you enter locally will not get overwritten when you sync from the cloud \r\n\r\nRunbooks \r\n\r\n - Native PowerShell and PowerShell Workflow runbooks are supported \r\n\r\nCheck the screenshot regarding this information below:\r\n![Official Notes](http:\/\/HarvestingClouds.com\/images\/1461735632572050d069253.png \"Official Notes\")\r\n\r\n### How much time it would take me\r\nIn all it would take you under 10 mins to get setup and rolling.\r\n\r\n### Where is more information on this and screenshots\r\nGo to the official [Technet blog by clicking HERE.](https:\/\/blogs.technet.microsoft.com\/msoms\/2016\/04\/08\/the-way-cool-azure-automation-powershell-ise-add-on\/)\r\n\r\nStart playing around and let us know your initial impression in the comments below.

Be it Private Cloud or Public Cloud, I will try to cover various aspects of both.\r\n\r\n### Private Cloud\r\n\r\nMy key areas of interest in Private Cloud include the following:\r\n\r\n* PowerShell Scripting\r\n* Windows Azure Pack or WAP\r\n* Service Management Automation or SMA\r\n* Azure Stack\r\n* System Center Orchestrator\r\n* System Center VMM and other products like Service Manager, Ops Mgr, etc.\r\n\r\n### Public Cloud\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Private Cloud the areas of interest in Public Cloud are:\r\n\r\n* Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services - both IaaS and PaaS\r\n* Azure Automation\r\n* Desired State Configurations\r\n* Application Insights\r\n* Azure Web Apps\r\n* Web APIs\r\n* Azure Site Recovery and Backup\r\n* Migrations from Private to Public Clouds\r\n\r\n### Common Areas & Best of both worlds\r\n\r\nI have also been involved in creating Hybrid clouds leveraging the best of both worlds. I will try to share my knowledge on this with you. The key aspects in this area are:\r\n* Building Hybrid Solutions\r\n* Developing Web or Desktop Applications targetting either or both the clouds (using MVC, Dot Net)\r\n* Using TFS Online, Visual Studio, GitHub to better collaborate and work in an automated fashion\r\n* Release Manager to automate your release workflows\r\n\r\n### Primary Focus\r\n\r\nAs you must have guessed by now, the primary focus for this blog will be Microsoft Technologies. We will also explore beyond this and will be talking about various emerging open source technologies and the new Better Together world with the amalgamation of various technologies in one solution.\r\n\r\nI invite to take this journey with me!\r\nKeep learning!\r\n",
