Parameters ##\r\nAs mentioned earlier, parameters are the way to customize the templates, each time you deploy it to create resources in Azure. These parameters are the end-user inputs for various aspects of the template. E.g. If you are deploying an Azure Virtual Machine via an ARM Template then the name of the VM can be an input parameter. Operating System type can be another parameter.\r\n\r\nThe parameters can be referred and used in other parts of the ARM Template.\r\n\r\n### Defining Parameters ###\r\nParameters is a one huge JSON object with multiple JSON properties. Each property is one parameter which is represented as another JSON object. Let us look at it's structure at high level.\r\n\r\n    \"parameters\": {\r\n                   \"parameter 1\" : {},\r\n                   \"parameter 2\" : {},\r\n                   \"parameter 3\" : {}\r\n    }\r\n\r\nE.g. If you are creating a template to deploy a Windows Virtual Machine then the parameters will look something like below:\r\n\r\n    \"parameters\": {\r\n                   \"VMName\" : {},\r\n                   \"AdminUserName\" : {},\r\n                   \"AdminPassword\" : {},\r\n                   \"WindowsOSVersion\" : {}\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNow let us look at one of the parameter. E.g. The AdminUserName parameter will look like:\r\n\r\n    \"adminUsername\": {\r\n                \"type\": \"string\",\r\n                \"minLength\": 1,\r\n                \"metadata\": {\r\n                    \"description\": \"Username for the Virtual Machine.\"\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n\r\nThe parameter object, as shown above, has following parts:\r\n 1. **Type** - This is the data Type of the parameter.\r\n 2. **minLength** - This is the minimum lenth the parameter must have\r\n 3. **Metadata** - This is just to provide a description as to what the parameter means.\r\n\r\nThe **Data Type** allowed for the parameter are:\r\n\r\n - string or secureString \u2013 any valid JSON string\r\n - int \u2013 any valid JSON integer\r\n - bool \u2013 any valid JSON boolean \r\n - object \u2013 any valid JSON object \r\n - array \u2013 any valid JSON array\r\n\r\nA more complex parameter e.g. Windows OS Version, with few more properties, is shown below:\r\n\r\n    \"windowsOSVersion\": {\r\n                \"type\": \"string\",\r\n                \"defaultValue\": \"2012-R2-Datacenter\",\r\n                \"allowedValues\": [\r\n                    \"2008-R2-SP1\",\r\n                    \"2012-Datacenter\",\r\n                    \"2012-R2-Datacenter\"\r\n                ],\r\n                \"metadata\": {\r\n                    \"description\": \"The Windows version for the VM. This will pick a fully patched image of this given Windows version. Allowed values: 2008-R2-SP1, 2012-Datacenter, 2012-R2-Datacenter.\"\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n\r\nIt has additional below properties:\r\n 1. **Default Value** - \r\n 2. **Allowed Values** - \r\n## 2. Variables ##\r\n\r\n## 3. Resources ##\r\n\r\n## 4. Outputs ##\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http:\/\/HarvestingClouds.com\/images\/147520488857edd71873f9b.png",

		"body": "Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates are written in JSON or **JavaScript Object Notation**. To understand ARM templates, you need to understand few quick basics about JSON. These will enable you to lay a great foundation which will enable you to understand ARM templates very easily.\r\n\r\nJSON or JavaScript Object Notation (pronounce like \"Jay-son\") is a text-based data format that's designed to be human-readable, lightweight, and easy to transmit between a server and a web client. Its syntax is derived from JavaScript. Think of this as an even more compact version of XML files.\r\n\r\nJSON is a popular notation for transmitting data through RESTful web services. The official internet media type for JSON is `application\/json`, and JSON files typically have a `.json` extension.\r\n\r\nTo understand JSON we need to understand **3 main components**. These components are like building blocks, using which you can build very complex JSON files.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 1. Objects ##\r\n\r\nObjects are the heart of JSON. Object denotes a real life object, e.g. an Employee. Just like a real life object, these have various properties and a value for each of these properties. E.g. An Employee will have Name property with value as John. Further, an employee object can have various another properties like Age, Salary, Department etc. So to denote an object in JSON you:\r\n\r\n - One object will be represented by curly brackets. It will begin from opening curly bracket i.e. `{` and will end at closing curly bracket i.e. `}`\r\n - Denote the property and corresponding values as `\"key\" : \"value\"` or `\"property\" : \"value\"` pairs.\r\n - You can only use double quotes for Properties as they will always be of type string\r\n - You will have double quotes around Values if they are of string type. You will not have any quotes in case of a number or a boolean value.\r\n - Each property will be separated from next property by a comma\r\n\r\n**Note:** Each JSON file is also a single JSON object. At root level it starts with an opening curly bracket i.e. `{` and will end with closing curly bracket i.e. `}`. There can't be any other objects at the root level. Think of this similar to how in an XML file there can be only one element at the root level. \r\n\r\nExample Employee object is shown below:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n        \"Name\" : \"John\",\r\n        \"Age\" : 34,\r\n        \"Department\" : \"Finance\",\r\n        \"Salary\" : \"100000\",\r\n        \"IsAdmin\" : true\r\n    }\r\n\r\n## 2. Arrays ##\r\n\r\nSimply put, arrays are a collection of items. In JSON the **square brackets** represents an Array. E.g. An array of 3 employees will look like below:\r\n\r\n    [\r\n      {\r\n            \"Name\" : \"John\",\r\n            \"Age\" : 34\r\n        },\r\n       {\r\n            \"Name\" : \"Mary\",\r\n            \"Age\" : 32\r\n        },\r\n       {\r\n            \"Name\" : \"Matthew\",\r\n            \"Age\" : 29\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n\r\n## 3. Nesting of Objects ##\r\nNow things get more interesting with nesting of Objects. What Nesting means is that one object can have it's property as another complex object. Don't worry if that sounds confusing. Let's understand that statement using an example. An Address where a person lives can be represented by an object. This object will look like below:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      \"StreetNumber\" : \"50\",\r\n      \"StreetName\" : \"Brian Harrison Way\",\r\n      \"Unit Number\" : 22,\r\n      \"City\" : \"Toronto\",\r\n      \"Country\" : \"Canada\"\r\n    }\r\nNow an Employee Object will have an Address object as one of it's property (because employee need to live somewhere). This new complex Employee object will look like below, with nested Address object as one of it's property:\r\n\r\n     {\r\n            \"Name\" : \"John\",\r\n            \"Age\" : 34,\r\n            \"Department\" : \"Finance\",\r\n            \"Salary\" : \"100000\",\r\n            \"IsAdmin\" : true,\r\n            \"Address\" :   {\r\n                              \"StreetNumber\" : \"50\",\r\n                              \"StreetName\" : \"Brian Harrison Way\",\r\n                              \"Unit Number\" : 22,\r\n                              \"City\" : \"Toronto\",\r\n                              \"Country\" : \"Canada\"\r\n                           }\r\n        }\r\n\r\nThat's all there is to it. Now you can use these 3 components and build very complex json files\/templates. Even the most complex template can be broken into these 3 components. \r\n\r\nBelow is a complex example with all 3 components. \r\n\r\n    {\r\n        \"Department\": \"Finance\",\r\n        \"TotalEmployees\": 2,\r\n        \"Employees\": [\r\n            {\r\n                \"Name\": \"John\",\r\n                \"Age\": 34,\r\n                \"Department\": \"Finance\",\r\n                \"Salary\": \"100000\",\r\n                \"IsAdmin\": true,\r\n                \"Address\": {\r\n                    \"StreetNumber\": \"50\",\r\n                    \"StreetName\": \"Brian Harrison Way\",\r\n                    \"Unit Number\": 22,\r\n                    \"City\": \"Toronto\",\r\n                    \"Country\": \"Canada\"\r\n                }\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                \"Name\": \"John\",\r\n                \"Age\": 34,\r\n                \"Department\": \"Finance\",\r\n                \"Salary\": \"100000\",\r\n                \"IsAdmin\": true,\r\n                \"Address\": {\r\n                    \"StreetNumber\": \"50\",\r\n                    \"StreetName\": \"Brian Harrison Way\",\r\n                    \"Unit Number\": 22,\r\n                    \"City\": \"Toronto\",\r\n                    \"Country\": \"Canada\"\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        ]\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe above JSON object denotes one department with name as Finance and total number of employees as 2. Then the \"Employees\" object is an array of 2 emplyees. Each emplyee object further have a complex property as Address, which is another object. \r\n\r\nIf you understood each of the 3 components, you should be able to build\/understand most complex JSON files with ease.",

Using these templates for all deployments provides you with various **benefits** including:\r\n\r\n - **Declarative Deployment** \u2013 All you need to do is declare what you need to deploy. You don't need to create any complex rules or write lengthy scripts.\r\n - **Idempotency** \u2013 You can deploy the same template over and over again without affecting the current resources.\r\n - **Predictability** - Using Templates you can have accurate predictability when performing large deployments. You reduce any manual errors.\r\n - **Repitition without Errors** - You can deploy the same infrastructure over and over again (e.g. in Dev-test environments and then in production).\r\n\r\nThis series of posts try to decode and understand the ARM Templates \"Step By Step\".\r\n\r\nThis post is an index of all the posts, in sequence, for understanding the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Templates.

The environment was managed by Third Party who did not want to give any service account for VMWare as their environment was shared with different customers. So we had access only to the VMs. Without relevant access, ASR for VMWare was out of the question for us.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nWe treated the VMs, in such environment, as physical machines when setting up ASR to replicate these machines to Azure. \r\nWe used the option of \"***Not virtualized\/other***\" in the \"***Prepare Infrastructure***\" wizard of ASR. We **treated the VMs as physical servers** and did not face any issues during the migration. \r\n\r\nRefer below screenshot for the exact option discussed above.\r\n\r\n![Protection Goal][1]\r\n\r\n\r\nLater when enabling the Replication for any Server, run the \"***Enable Replication***\" wizard by clicking on \"**+Replicate**\" on the ASR vault's blade. Then select \"**Machine Type**\" as \"***Physical Machine***\" and add the Physical Machines by mentioning their IP addresses. \r\n\r\n**Note:** For this approach to work, the Configuration server should be on the same network as the VM being considered as Physical Machine.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe were able to migrate many servers successfully and without any issues using this approach.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http:\/\/HarvestingClouds.com\/images\/14696297155798c513ea908.png",

		"category": "Azure",
		"body": "**Azure blob storage** can provide a very highly available way to store your files in the cloud. You can dynamically add or remove the files in an automated fashion. These files can then be used for any number of purposes. E.g. A parameter file for ARM template can be kept in Azure blob storage and then dynamically read while creating resources from an ARM template.\r\n\r\n**The whole process can be broken down into 3 parts**:\r\n\r\n 1. Generating the context to the storage container\r\n 2. Uploading the files using the context\r\n 3. Downloading the files using the context\r\n\r\n### 1. Generating the context to the storage container\r\nThe context to the storage blob container can be created in one of the 3 ways, based on your security requirements. All methods use the `New-AzureStorageContext` cmdlet to generate the storage context. The methods differ on how you pass the parameters to this cmdlet.\r\n\r\n**A. Via fetching the Azure Storage Key**\r\n\r\nThis first method uses the `Get-AzureStorageKey` to fetch the storage key. This key is then used to generate the context as shown below.\r\n\r\n    $StorageAccountName = \"yourstorageaccount\"\r\n    $StorageAccountKey = Get-AzureStorageKey -StorageAccountName $StorageAccountName\r\n    $Ctx = New-AzureStorageContext $StorageAccountName -StorageAccountKey $StorageAccountKey.Primary\r\n\r\n**B. Via fetching the Azure Storage Container SAS Token**\r\n\r\nThis second method uses the `New-AzureStorageContainerSASToken` to create a new SAS token to securely access the storage container. This token is then used to generate the context as shown below.\r\n\r\n    $sasToken = New-AzureStorageContainerSASToken -Container abc -Permission rl\r\n    $Ctx = New-AzureStorageContext -StorageAccountName $StorageAccountName -SasToken $sasToken\r\n\r\n**C. Via Connectin String**\r\n\r\nThis third method uses a connection string, entered manually, which is then used to generate the context as shown below.\r\n\r\n    $ConnectionString = \"DefaultEndpointsProtocol=http;BlobEndpoint=<blobEndpoint>;QueueEndpoint=<QueueEndpoint>;TableEndpoint=<TableEndpoint>;AccountName=<AccountName>;AccountKey=<AccountKey>\"\r\n    $Ctx = New-AzureStorageContext -ConnectionString $ConnectionString\r\n\r\n### 2. Uploading the files using the context\r\n\r\nNow that you have the context to the storage account you can upload and download files from the storage blob container.\r\nUse the below code to upload a file named \"_Parameters.json_\", located on the local machine at \"_C:\\Temp_\" directory.\r\n\r\n    #Uploading File\r\n    $BlobName = \"Parameters.json\"\r\n    $localFile = \"C:\\Temp\\\" + $BlobName\r\n\r\n    #Note the Force switch will overwrite if the file already exists in the Azure container\r\n    Set-AzureStorageBlobContent -File $localFile -Container $ContainerName -Blob $BlobName -Context $Ctx -Force\r\n\r\n### 3. Downloading the files using the context\r\n\r\nDownload works in almost identical manner. You use the Get cmdlet instead of Set as shown below to download a file to a local folder, located at \"_C:\\Downloads_\".\r\n\r\n    #Download File\r\n    $BlobName = \"Parameters.json\"\r\n    $localTargetDirectory = \"C:\\Downloads\"\r\n\r\n    Get-AzureStorageBlobContent -Blob $BlobName -Container $ContainerName -Destination $localTargetDirectory -Context $ctx\r\n\r\nI hope this helps simplify the automated usage of Azure Storage container. Let us know your concerns or questions if any.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Reference:** <a href=\"https:\/\/azure.microsoft.com\/en-us\/documentation\/articles\/storage-powershell-guide-full\/\" target=\"_blank\">Using Azure PowerShell with Azure Storage<\/a>",

This solves a big pain point for all Azure developers.\r\nNow you will be able to develop and test your scripts right from the convenience of your laptop's local PowerShell ISE. \r\n\r\n### What you need to do\r\nAll you need to do is install the PowerShell Add-On using the below cmdlet:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nFind-Module AzureAutomationAuthoringToolkit | Install-Module -Scope CurrentUser\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen import the module using below cmdlet:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nImport-Module AzureAutomationAuthoringToolkit\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can configure the Add-On using a Configuration tab in the add-on and start getting your hands dirty. \r\n\r\n### Official Information from the Add-On Help\r\n\r\n#### Capabilities\r\n\r\n - Test runbooks on your local machine and in the Azure Automation service: \r\n - Store and edit Automation Assets locally \r\n - Use Automation Activities (Get-AutomationVariable, Get-AutomationPSCredential, etc) in local PowerShell scripts \r\n - Sync changes back to your Automation Account \r\n - Run test jobs in Automation and view results \r\n\r\n#### Notes\r\nAssets\r\n\r\n - Secret values (passwords, encrypted variables) are not downloaded automatically; they need to be set manually the first time the account is synced \r\n - Values that haven't been downloaded will be highlighted \r\n - Asset values you enter locally will not get overwritten when you sync from the cloud \r\n\r\nRunbooks \r\n\r\n - Native PowerShell and PowerShell Workflow runbooks are supported \r\n\r\nCheck the screenshot regarding this information below:\r\n![Official Notes](http:\/\/HarvestingClouds.com\/images\/1461735632572050d069253.png \"Official Notes\")\r\n\r\n### How much time it would take me\r\nIn all it would take you under 10 mins to get setup and rolling.\r\n\r\n### Where is more information on this and screenshots\r\nGo to the official [Technet blog by clicking HERE.](https:\/\/blogs.technet.microsoft.com\/msoms\/2016\/04\/08\/the-way-cool-azure-automation-powershell-ise-add-on\/)\r\n\r\nStart playing around and let us know your initial impression in the comments below.

To have multiple filters in the same column you need to update the way filtering works in the tool itself.\r\n\r\nI have used a list of checkboxes and any or all of the elements selected in this checkbox list will be used for filtering the column values.\r\n\r\nYou can find the code in my fork of the official Grid.Mvc repo at below link:\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/HarvestingClouds\/Grid.Mvc\" target=\"_blank\">Fork of Grid.Mvc repo with Advance Filters<\/a>\r\n\r\nI have also created a pull request for the same so that more people get benefit from this if they refer the master branch of the main repo.\r\n\r\n### What are the changes I have done?\r\nI have made changes to two files:\r\n\r\n 1. **DefaultColumnFilter.cs** file in \"**GridMvc**\" class library project under the Filters folder. I have updated the GetFilterExpression method to create multiple expressions based on the pipeline character in filter values.\r\n 2. **gridmvc.customwidgets.js** file in \"**GridMvc.Site**\" web application project\r\n\r\nBoth of these paths are shown below:\r\nLocation of DefaultColumnFilter.cs:\r\n![DefaultColumnFilter.cs](http:\/\/HarvestingClouds.com\/images\/146173541957204ffb99678.png \"DefaultColumnFilter.cs\")\r\n\r\nLocation of gridmvc.customwidgets.js:\r\n![gridmvc.customwidgets.js](http:\/\/HarvestingClouds.com\/images\/146173543057205006529e6.png \"gridmvc.customwidgets.js\")\r\n\r\nHow the end result look like:\r\n![Checkbox Filtering](http:\/\/HarvestingClouds.com\/images\/14617354255720500171fe7.png \"Checkbox Filtering\")\r\n\r\nYou can directly use the code if you want.

But it is production ready for all the Hyper-V related scenarios.\r\n**Your older Vaults (created via Classic ASM Azure Portal) will not be available in ASR preview feature.**\r\n\r\n### What are the new features\r\n\r\nThe new features include:\r\n\r\n* All the goodness of Azure Resource Manager in ASR\r\n* Lean experience for various ASR scenarios\r\n* Enhancements to the specific Site Recovery scenarios\r\n\r\n### Lets take a quick look at some of these.\r\n\r\nIf you Browse and search for \"Recovery\" you get Recovery Services Vaults as Preview feature.\r\n![Browse and Search](http:\/\/HarvestingClouds.com\/images\/14617358075720517f78904.png \"Browse and Search\")\r\n\r\nClicking on it will open up the blade for \"Recovery Services valuts\". Notice that Microsoft has PREVIEW text in this.\r\n![alt text](http:\/\/HarvestingClouds.com\/images\/1461735702572051161683f.png \"ASR Vault\")\r\n\r\nClicking on the Add button brings up the ASR vault creation blade.

I tested for East US location and it was created in under 10 secs.\r\nRefresh to view your newly created vault. Click on it to open the NEW ASR Vault features. Notice that the Backup feature is also there in the ASR vault now.\r\n![New Vault](http:\/\/HarvestingClouds.com\/images\/1461735907572051e31549a.png \"New Vault\")\r\n\r\nTo find the options for replication go to Settings -> Getting Started section -> Site Recovery -> Follow Wizard.\r\n![New Site Recovery Wizard](http:\/\/HarvestingClouds.com\/images\/1461735869572051bd2d6fa.png \"New Site Recovery Wizard\")\r\n\r\nThe Scenario Types available are only two. But all the scenarios are covered here:\r\n\r\n* From my site to Azure\r\n* From my site to another site\r\n\r\nBased on the scenario you select you are asked for different options. The options for Virtualization\/Management Server type for \"From my site to Azure\" are:\r\n\r\n* VMM\r\n* Stand alone Hyper-V hosts\r\n* vCenter\r\n* Physical machines (not virtualized)\r\n![Creation Options](http:\/\/HarvestingClouds.com\/images\/14617358385720519e578ba.png \"Creation Options\")\r\n\r\n### Backup in ASR vault\r\nAnother feature is creation of Backups from the same vault. Click on the + icon for Backup in the Vault main blade and then follow the wizard for the preview feature.\r\n![Backup In ASR](http:\/\/HarvestingClouds.com\/images\/14617357575720514d5d1d8.png \"Backup In ASR\")\r\nNotice in the screenshot above that the backup types available are:\r\n\r\n* Azure virtual machine backup\r\n* File Folder backup\r\n* System Center Data Protection Manager\r\n\r\nSelecting each option provides you with details for next steps. You can then create a backup policy and configure Items to backup.\r\n\r\nGive these features a try and let us know in comments below how you find the new features.\r\nHappy Exploring!",
