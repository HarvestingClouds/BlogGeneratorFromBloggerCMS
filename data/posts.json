This often results in \"Capacity Allocation\" errors and your VMs will not come up. The solution is to either select an alternate SKU (if that is available) or reserve the capacity beforehand. \r\n\r\nNow, this experience is inbuilt into Azure Site Recovery (ASR). You have two places where you can set this up. \r\n\r\n## During Enabling Replication ##\r\n\r\nWhen you are enabling the replication, you can select the Capacity Reservation Settings.

To this navigate to your Recovery Services Vault. Then navigate to the \"Replicated items\" under \"Protected items\" -> then select the VM for which you want to update the settings. Then navigate to the Compute settings under General. This is where you will see the \"Capacity Reservation Settings\". \r\n\r\nSimilar to what you did during enabling the replication, you can select a Capacity Reservation Group here.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/16475804966234155069e29.png\" alt=\"Capacity Reservation under Compute Settings\">\r\n\r\n**References**: \r\n - <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/virtual-machines\/capacity-reservation-overview\" target=\"_blank\">On-demand Capacity Reservation<\/a>\r\n - <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/site-recovery\/azure-to-azure-common-questions#capacity\" target=\"_blank\">Why to use Capacity Reservations<\/a>",

This is a most common requirement when you are performing a failover in a disaster scenario.

This often results in \"Capacity Allocation\" errors and your VMs will not come up. The solution is to either select an alternate SKU (if that is available) or reserve capacity beforehand. \r\n\r\n## Differences ##\r\n\r\n**Capacity Reservation** is different from **Reserved Instances**. Here are the key differences:\r\n\r\n 1. **Time considerations (Term)** - Reserved Instance is a commitment to use a resource for a period of time. You get a discount for this commitment. E.g. 1-year or 3-year commitment on a VM. Capacity Reservation doesn't have a time\/term commitment. It can be for any duration of time. The capacity is reserved and available immediately until the reservation is deleted.\r\n 2. **Linking** - Reserved Instance is linked only to the VM size. The Capacity Reservation is defined with the combination of VM size, location, and quantity of instances to be reserved.\r\n 3. **Capacity Guarantee (SLA)** - Reserver Instances don't guarantee the capacity. If the VM SKU is out of capacity you will get a Capacity Allocation error. Capacity Reservation guarantees capacity availability.\r\n 4. **Region vs Availability Zones** - Capacity Reservations can be done for a region or an Availability Zone. Reserver Instances are available at the region level e.g. East US or Central US etc.\r\n 5. **Billing** - Reserved Instances provide you a discount by committing to a term. Capacity Reservations cost you with pay-as-you-go rates for the underlying VM. More on this in the next section.\r\n\r\n## Pricing ##\r\n\r\nCapacity Reservations are priced at the same rate as the underlying VM size (with pay-as-you-go rates). E.g. You have 4 D4s_v3 VMs for which you reserve the capacity. Then you will be charged for 8 VMs. 4 running VMs (as per their usage) and 4 capacity reservations (regardless of whether you use these or not).\r\n\r\nBut if you have the Reserved Instances, then Reserved Capacity is provided free of cost.\r\n\r\nAlso, when you are using the capacity that you reserved via Capacity Reservations then there is no additional charge for the reservation (other than the VM cost for the up and running VM).\r\n\r\n## Caveats ##\r\n\r\n - While creating the Capacity Reservation, the capacity should be available in the target region or Availability Zone, otherwise, the reservation will fail (just like VM creation).\r\n - Spot VMs and Azure Dedicated Host Nodes are not supported\r\n - Availability Sets are not supported\r\n - Deployment constraints like Proximity Placement Group, Update domains, and UltraSSD storage are also not supported\r\n - Only Av2, B, D, E, & F VM series are supported right now. The SKUs will expand in near future.\r\n - Only the subscription that created the reservation can use it.\r\n - Reservations are only available to paid Azure customers\r\n\r\n**References**: \r\n - <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/virtual-machines\/capacity-reservation-overview\" target=\"_blank\">On-demand Capacity Reservation<\/a>\r\n - <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/site-recovery\/azure-to-azure-common-questions#capacity\" target=\"_blank\">Why to use Capacity Reservations<\/a>",

		"body": "This blog is a part of the **Windows Admin Center in the Azure portal** series. You can find the **Index** of this series here: <a href=\"https:\/\/harvestingclouds.com\/post\/windows-admin-center-in-the-azure-portal-index\/\" target=\"_blank\">Windows Admin Center in the Azure portal<\/a>.\r\n\r\nIn this post, we will look at how to automate the deployment and how to extend that to perform deployment on multiple VMs at once. You can automated via different ways including ARM templates and PowerShell.\r\n\r\n## Automating with ARM Template ##\r\n\r\nWhen using ARM Templates, all you need to do is to deploy a resource of type \"*Microsoft.Compute\/virtualMachines\/extensions*\". The extension name that you are deploying is \"**AdminCenter**\" and the publisher is \"**Microsoft.AdminCenter**\". Extension type is also \"**AdminCenter**\".\r\n\r\nThe latest template can be found here: <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows-server\/manage\/windows-admin-center\/azure\/manage-vm#automate-windows-admin-center-deployment-using-an-arm-template\" target=\"_blank\">Automate Windows Admin Center deployment using an ARM template<\/a>\r\n\r\n## Automating with PowerShell ##\r\n\r\nWith PowerShell you are performing the below 3 operations to install the extension:\r\n\r\n 1. Getting the Network Security Group and adding the outbound rule to allow HTTPS traffic on port 443 to the WindowsAdminCenter Service Tag\r\n 2. Getting the Network Security Group and adding the inbound rule to allow traffic on the Windows Admin Center management port for allowed (or all) IP addresses. You should either not have this rule in case of connectivity on a private IP address. Or lock it down to specific IPs in case of connectivity via Public IP addresses.\r\n 3. Installing the \"**AdminCenter**\" extension using the \"**Set-AzVMExtension**\" PowerShell cmdlet.\r\n\r\nUse the below PowerShell script from official Microsoft documentation:\r\n\r\n    $resourceGroupName = <get VM's resource group name>\r\n    $vmLocation = <get VM location>\r\n    $vmName = <get VM name>\r\n    $vmNsg = <get VM's primary nsg>\r\n    $salt = <unique string used for hashing>\r\n    \r\n    $wacPort = \"6516\"\r\n    $Settings = @{\"port\" = $wacPort; \"salt\" = $salt}\r\n\r\n    # Open outbound port rule for WAC service\r\n    Get-AzNetworkSecurityGroup -Name $vmNsg -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName | Add-AzNetworkSecurityRuleConfig -Name \"PortForWACService\" -Access \"Allow\" -Direction \"Outbound\" -SourceAddressPrefix \"VirtualNetwork\" -SourcePortRange \"*\" -DestinationAddressPrefix \"WindowsAdminCenter\" -DestinationPortRange \"443\" -Priority 100 -Protocol Tcp | Set-AzNetworkSecurityGroup\r\n    \r\n    # Open inbound port rule on VM to be able to connect to WAC\r\n    Get-AzNetworkSecurityGroup -Name $vmNsg -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName | Add-AzNetworkSecurityRuleConfig -Name \"PortForWAC\" -Access \"Allow\" -Direction \"Inbound\" -SourceAddressPrefix \"*\" -SourcePortRange \"*\" -DestinationAddressPrefix \"*\" -DestinationPortRange $wacPort -Priority 100 -Protocol Tcp | Set-AzNetworkSecurityGroup\r\n    \r\n    # Install VM extension\r\n    Set-AzVMExtension -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName -Location $vmLocation -VMName $vmName -Name \"AdminCenter\" -Publisher \"Microsoft.AdminCenter\" -Type \"AdminCenter\" -TypeHandlerVersion \"0.0\" -settings $Settings\r\n\r\n## Extending PowerShell to deploy on multiple VMs ##\r\n\r\nYou can extend the PowerShell or the ARM Template to deploy the Windows Admin Center to multiple VMs. You can even leverage Azure DevOps pipelines to deploy these across different environments.

You can find the **Index** of this series here: <a href=\"https:\/\/harvestingclouds.com\/post\/windows-admin-center-in-the-azure-portal-index\/\" target=\"_blank\">Windows Admin Center in the Azure portal<\/a>.\r\n\r\nIn this post, we will look at troubleshooting common issues with the Windows Admin Center.\r\n\r\n## 1. Dealing with the Security prompt while connecting to the Windows Admin Center ##\r\n\r\nIf you get a security prompt while connecting to the Windows Admin Center, then click on the \"Advanced\" button and then click on the link as shown below to continue.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/1647387071623121bfddaae.png\" alt=\"Security Prompt\">\r\n\r\n**PRO TIP**: If you are not able to see the link or the complete text after clicking on the \"Advanced\" button, press F11 to enter the full-screen mode. This should make the entire text and the link visible. Another way is to set the zoom level to a low number to ensure the whole text is visible.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 2. Tools Not loading or Not able to connect ##\r\n\r\nIf when trying to access the tools you keep getting the below spinning circle. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/16474124956231850fab392.png\" alt=\"Spinning wheel\">\r\n\r\nAnd then it keeps turning into \"**couldn't load**\" errors.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/1647412504623185187a091.png\" alt=\"Couldn't load error\">\r\n\r\n### Solution ###\r\n\r\nNavigate to other tools and then back to the required tool to check if the issue is not limited to the required tool or is across the board for all other tools. If this issue is prevalent with all the tools then try the following steps.\r\n\r\n - **Step #1** - Try refreshing the browser and connecting again to the Windows Admin Center. I know it sounds basic but this saves you from unnecessary troubleshooting.\r\n - **Step #2** - Make sure that the VM is in the up and running state. We have seen this issue multiple times in our environment.\r\n - **Step #3** - Make sure that the NSG rules have not been altered and that the network connectivity is still there. If you are connecting from a different location than before, make sure that the inbound connectivity is allowed from your new location to the VM. Network connectivity is another big reason for connectivity failures.\r\n - **Step #4** - Make sure that the Windows Admin Center service is running on your VM. RDP to the VM and check if ServerManagementGateway \/ Windows Admin Center service is in the Running state or not.\r\n - **Step #5** - Make sure you are connecting from Microsoft Edge or Chrome and that you are not using incognito mode.\r\n\r\nIn most cases, step #2 or #3 will help you resolve the connectivity issues.\r\n\r\n## 3. Windows Admin Center extension not installing ##\r\n\r\nThe most usual reason for this error is that your VM doesn't meet the requirements for the Windows Admin Center. Make sure that you are running the Windows Server 2016, 2019 or 2022 as the operating system on the VM and that you have a minimum of 3 GiB memory.\r\n\r\nReview all the requirements here: <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows-server\/manage\/windows-admin-center\/azure\/manage-vm#requirements\" target=\"_blank\">Windows Admin Center requirements<\/a>\r\n\r\nThe networking restrictions in your environment are another main cause of causing installation issues. If there are User Defined Routes (via Route Tables) and an Azure Firewall or any Network Virtual Appliance that may cause unsupported configuration.",

This is shown in the Inbound security rules of the Network Security Group (NSG) for the VM.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/1647383498623113ca4332d.png\" alt=\"Inbound Security Rule\">\r\n\r\nThis is a **potential security risk** as it leaves the system vulnerable and the port open for access for all attackers on the public internet.\r\n\r\n## The Solution #1 ##\r\n\r\nThe solution is very simple. The solution is to lock it down to only a specific IP address or a range of IP addresses. This limits which IP addresses can access Windows Admin Center on the VM. \r\n\r\nTo be able to do this, you will need to update the Inbound rule on the Network Security Group as shown above and then update the \"**Source**\" for the rule. Instead of \"**Any**\" change that to the public IP address of the VM from where you are connecting to the Windows Admin Center (within Azure portal). If you know a range of IPs that you will be using then you can specify the range instead.\r\n\r\n## How to find your current Public IP address ##\r\n\r\nYour ISP will provide you with a dynamic public IP address (unless you purchased a static public IP). To be able to find your public IP address just search for \"what is my IP address\" and you will find many third-party websites that will show you your current public IP address and possible geographic location. One such website is provided below, just as a reference:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.whatismyip.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">https:\/\/www.whatismyip.com\/<\/a>\r\n\r\n## The Solution #2 ##\r\n\r\nThe second solution is to simply remove the inbound NSG rule and allow access only on the private IP address. This would mean that you would need to have connectivity to the VM's virtual network from where you are trying to access the Windows Admin Center on the VM (via Azure portal). \r\n\r\nThis is a much more secure solution and ensures that there is no connectivity allowed from the public IP to the VM.",

You can find the **Index** of this series here: <a href=\"https:\/\/harvestingclouds.com\/post\/windows-admin-center-in-the-azure-portal-index\/\" target=\"_blank\">Windows Admin Center in the Azure portal<\/a>.\r\n\r\nIn the previous posts, we looked at different aspects of the Windows Admin Center from setting it up, to configuring it, and using various tools in it. In this post, we will look at various caveats and know limitations of this product.\r\n\r\n## 1. Usage with Virtual Appliances ##\r\n\r\nInbound connectivity being redirected by another service (i.e. Network Virtual Appliances, Azure Firewall, etc.) is not supported. You must have inbound connectivity from the Azure portal to one of the direct IP addresses of your VM on the port Windows Admin Center is installed. \r\n\r\nNetwork Virtual Appliance could be a third-party firewall like Palo Alto, Check Point, etc. Azure Firewall, a cloud-native network security service, is another solution that can exist between the communication. If via User Defined Routes (within Route Tables) or any other way the communication is not direct then the Windows Admin Center will not work. Hopefully, this restriction will be removed in near future.\r\n\r\n## 2. Extending Windows Admin Center to Other VMs ##\r\n\r\nMicrosoft doesn't support extensions to Windows Admin Center in the Azure portal at the time of writing this post. If you manually installed Windows Admin Center in the VM to manage multiple systems, installing this VM extension reduces the functionality to managing just the VM in which the extension is installed. You will need to uninstall the extension to get back the functionality of managing multiple VMs at once.\r\n\r\n## 3. Usage with Non-public cloud ##\r\n\r\nWindows Admin Center is currently supported only on the Azure public cloud. It is not supported in Azure China, Azure Government, or other non-public clouds.\r\n\r\n## 4. Supported Browsers\/Apps ##\r\n\r\nWindows Admin Center is currently supported only on the Microsoft Edge or Chrome browsers. Chrome Incognito mode isn't supported for now. Also, the Azure portal desktop app is not supported.\r\n\r\nReference: <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows-server\/manage\/windows-admin-center\/azure\/manage-vm\" target=\"_blank\">Use Windows Admin Center in the Azure portal to manage a Windows Server VM<\/a>",

In this post, we will explore more tools present in it. These tools are what provide server management functionality.\r\n\r\n## 10. Processes ##\r\n\r\nWith Processes, you can view all the processes on the VM. You can also start a new process or end an existing one.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/1647400410623155dad04b6.png\" alt=\"Processes\">\r\n\r\n## 11. Registry ##\r\n\r\nIn the Registry tool, you can view the existing registries. You can also export or create a new registry.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/1647400418623155e2dc812.png\" alt=\"Registry \">\r\n\r\n\r\n## 12. Remote Desktop ##\r\n\r\nFrom the remote desktop, you can connect to the VM and perform VM operations (that you can't from the Windows admin center. First, you provide the credentials and connect to the VM.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/1647400433623155f19644a.png\" alt=\"Remote Desktop - Connection Wizard\">\r\n\r\nThen, once you are connected you can perform operations on the VM, or disconnect. You also have the option to send the Ctrl+Alt+Del keyboard combination to the VM.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/1647400426623155ea7d2e6.png\" alt=\"Remote Desktop - Connect Experience\">\r\n\r\n\r\n## 13. Roles & features ##\r\n\r\nFrom roles and features, you can view current roles and features and also add\/install new ones.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/1647401197623158ed1a8fa.png\" alt=\"Roles & features\">\r\n\r\n\r\n## 14. Scheduled tasks ##\r\n\r\nWith scheduled tasks, you can view the \"Task Scheduler Library\". Here you can view all the existing tasks or you can create new tasks. You can also enable and disable existing tasks.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/1647401208623158f86de42.png\" alt=\"Scheduled tasks\">\r\n\r\n\r\n## 15. Security ##\r\n\r\nSecurity is where you can access the Virus and threat protection. You can create or schedule a new scan and view the protection history. You can schedule daily or weekly scans here.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/16474012186231590256f12.png\" alt=\"Security\">\r\n\r\n\r\n## 16. Services ##\r\n\r\nThe Services tool is similar to the \"services.msc\" management tool on the VM. It lets you manage all the services. You can Start and Stop any service. You can also change different settings for a service like a startup mode, log-on account, recovery options, etc.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/16474012276231590b59444.png\" alt=\"Services \">\r\n\r\n\r\n## 17. Storage ##\r\n\r\nStorage tool is similar to disk management. You can view all the disks and volumes in the VM here. You can also create a new volume or initialize a disk here. Imagine you added or upgraded a disk in the Azure portal. You can then visit this tool and initialize that new disk and create a volume from the same.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/164740127162315937ae87f.png\" alt=\"Storage \">\r\n\r\n\r\n## 18. Updates ##\r\n\r\nUpdates tool lets you manage the updates on the VM. You can view available updates and also trigger the installation of the same. You can also view the Update history.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/16474012786231593e78d56.png\" alt=\"Updates \">\r\n\r\nThese are all the tools that are available in the Windows Admin Center today. The best way to learn about each is to play around and experiment with these tools on a demo VM.\r\n\r\nIn the next post, we will look at some caveats with the Windows Admin Center.\r\n",

In this post, we will explore the different tools present in it. These tools are what provide server management functionality. Without waiting let's jump right into it.\r\n\r\n## 1. Certificates ##\r\n\r\nThe certificates section allows you to review and manage the certificates on the VM. It shows you how many have expired and how many are healthy. It also allows you to view various certificates and to import certificates into a particular store. You can also view certificate-related events.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/1647396946623148520f69b.png\" alt=\"Certificates\">\r\n\r\n## 2. Devices ##\r\n\r\nThe devices tool is basically your \"Device Manager\". It lets you view and enable or disable devices. It also lets you update the driver for the selected device. You can view details regarding each device and it's driver e.g. driver date and version, etc.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/16473969626231486213bbc.png\" alt=\"Devices\">\r\n\r\n\r\n## 3. Events ##\r\n\r\nThe events tool is essentially your \"event viewer\". It lets you view the following types of events:\r\n\r\n 1. Administrative logs\r\n 2. Windows logs\r\n 3. Applications and services logs\r\n\r\nYou can also export or clear the logs from here as well.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/16473969826231487688ad6.png\" alt=\"Events\">\r\n\r\n\r\n## 4. Files & file sharing ##\r\n\r\nIn the Files and file sharing you can manage the files on the VM. With Files, you can browse to the files, rename these, create new folders, delete files, move these, upload files, etc. With file shares, you can view different file shares, create new shares, edit the settings of the shares, grant permissions, enable SMB encryption, etc.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/1647396994623148825677e.png\" alt=\"Files & file sharing\">\r\n\r\n\r\n## 5. Firewall ##\r\n\r\nThe firewall tool lets you manage the firewall on the VM. It lets you view the firewall status for the Domain, Private and Public areas. It also lets you view the inbound and outbound rules. You can also create new rules for the incoming and outgoing traffic here.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/1647397044623148b49ccb6.png\" alt=\"Firewall\">\r\n\r\n\r\n## 6. Installed apps ##\r\n\r\nIn the installed apps, you can view all the installed apps. You can also remove any app directly from here as well.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/1647397055623148bf03de1.png\" alt=\"Installed apps\">\r\n\r\n\r\n## 7. Local users & groups ##\r\n\r\nThe tool for local users and groups you can manage all users and groups. For users, you can view current users, manage their memberships and create new local users. Under groups, you can view groups, add users to the existing groups, create new groups, delete existing groups, etc.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/164739748262314a6a3750f.png\" alt=\"Local users & groups\">\r\n\r\n## 8. Performance Monitor ##\r\n\r\nIn performance monitor, you need to create a workspace to view the performance counters. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/164739749362314a75563ea.png\" alt=\"Performance Monitor\">\r\n\r\nYou can view all the counters that you can locally on the laptop. You can save the settings once you have set these up for easy viewing next time.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/164739750362314a7f3cb2e.png\" alt=\"Performance Monitor - Workspace\">\r\n\r\n\r\n## 9. PowerShell ##\r\n\r\nThe PowerShell tool lets you connect to a PowerShell session as if you are logged into the VM. You can run all the PowerShell commands as if you are inside the VM.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/164739751462314a8aa4343.png\" alt=\"PowerShell\">\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the next post, we will continue looking at more tools within Windows Admin Center.",

You can find the **Index** of this series here: <a href=\"https:\/\/harvestingclouds.com\/post\/windows-admin-center-in-the-azure-portal-index\/\" target=\"_blank\">Windows Admin Center in the Azure portal<\/a>.\r\n\r\nIn the last post, we saw how to connect to the **Windows Admin Center**. In this post, we will explore it in detail. It helps you to manage the Windows Server directly from the Azure portal similar to the on-premises version of the Windows Admin Center. \r\n\r\n## Getting Familiar with the UI ##\r\n\r\nLet's start by getting familiar with the User Interface (UI) of the Windows Admin Center.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/16473882546231265ee4848.png\" alt=\"Windows Admin Center UI\">\r\n\r\nAs you see above, the various parts of the Windows Admin Center are as below. Note that the line item corresponds to the number in the above screenshot.\r\n\r\n 1. At the top you select the **connection type**. You have **Server Manager** selected. Other choices include Computer Management and Cluster Management. These choices are not relevant right now but will be helpful in the near future to manage the Computers and Clusters.\r\n 2. The main page can be accessed from the **Overview** screen. This is the default screen that is presented when you open Windows Admin Center. We will discuss more on this in points #5 and #6 below.\r\n 3. There are **various tools** in this section. Use the vertical scroll bar to view all of these tools.\r\n 4. You can view different **Settings on the VM** from here.\r\n 5. You can use the **Connect** option in the Overview page to either do Remote Desktop or open a PowerShell session to the computer.\r\n 6. The main page for the **Overview** provides lots of detail for the VM including internal computer name, domain, operating system, version, memory, disk space, processor, uptime, etc. This also provides the graph for CPU, memory, and network usage.\r\n 7. This option shows you various **PowerShell script samples** for the tool that you have selected from the #3 section above. E.g. for the Installed apps section, it shows you commonly used scripts like enabling and disabling features, removing apps, etc.\r\n 8. This is the **notification** section for the whole Windows Admin Center\r\n 9. This is the **Settings** section for the whole Windows Admin Center which includes accounts management (with which you connected to it), language\/region selection, personalization (selection of light or dark modes), and various other settings.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Using Azure services in Windows Admin Center ##\r\n\r\nTo be able to use Azure services in the Windows Admin Center you need to register the gateway with Azure. You can do so by navigating to the settings and then going to Account i.e. the first setting. Then click on the link for \"*Register with Azure*\".\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/164738927262312a588b93e.png\" alt=\"Register Gateway with Azure\">\r\n\r\n## VM Settings ##\r\n\r\nNavigate to the VM settings by clicking on the Settings under the tools section (on the left bottom corner). Here you can manage the below settings:\r\n\r\n 1. File Shares (SMB Server) settings\r\n 2. Environment Variables - both user and system variables\r\n 3. Power Configurations\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/164739386162313c45e5c12.png\" alt=\"VM Level Settings\">\r\n\r\nYou can not only view the settings but also add\/update the settings. E.g. you can create a new environment variable for the user or system. Or you can update the power configuration to a balanced, high-performance, or power saver.\r\n\r\n## Windows Admin Center Settings ##\r\n\r\nThe Windows Admin Center Settings can be accessed by clicking on the gear icon on the top right section. These settings are clubbed into 3 categories which include:\r\n\r\n 1. User settings\r\n 2. Development settings\r\n 3. Gateway settings\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/164739458862313f1c3bfba.png\" alt=\"Windows Admin Center Settings\">\r\n\r\nUser settings deal with the account, language, region, personalization-related settings. This is where you select if you want the default light mode or the dark mode.\r\n\r\nThe development settings section is where you can enable the toolset to build extensions for the Windows Admin Center itself. It allows you to collect performance data as well.\r\n\r\nThe gateway section allows you to control the gateway settings i.e. how you connect to the Windows Admin Center.\r\n\r\nIn the next post, we will look at various tools present in the Windows Admin Center.",

Now let's look at how to connect to it.\r\n\r\n## Connecting ##\r\n\r\nTo connect to the Windows Admin Center: \r\n\r\n 1. Navigate to the VM, then under the **Settings** click on the \"**Windows Admin Center**\". \r\n 2. In the middle of the blade, select the public or private IP address of the VM to connect to.\r\n 3. And then click on the \"**Connect**\" button.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/164738651362311f9150f66.png\" alt=\"Connect to Windows Admin Center\">\r\n\r\nNext, it will ask you to log in to Windows Admin Center using your machine's admin credentials. Note these are the local machine admin credentials (and not the Azure portal user credentials).\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/1647386801623120b13805f.png\" alt=\"Sign in\">\r\n\r\nIf you get a security prompt, then click on \"Advanced\" and then click on the link as shown below to continue.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/1647387071623121bfddaae.png\" alt=\"Security Prompt\">\r\n\r\n**PRO TIP**: If you are not able to see the link or the complete text after clicking on the \"Advanced\" button, press F11 to enter the full-screen mode. This should make the entire text and the link visible. Another way is to set the zoom level to a low number to ensure the whole text is visible.\r\n\r\nFinally, click on the gateway to connect.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/164738723862312266b6596.png\" alt=\"Windows Admin Center Gateway\">\r\n\r\nYou are now finally connected with the Windows Admin Center. Explore the different options available to you here to manage your server.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/16473874856231235dd79bd.png\" alt=\"Windows Admin Center\">\r\n\r\nWe will explore these options in detail in the upcoming posts.",

You can find the **Index** of this series here: <a href=\"https:\/\/harvestingclouds.com\/post\/windows-admin-center-in-the-azure-portal-index\/\" target=\"_blank\">Windows Admin Center in the Azure portal<\/a>.\r\n\r\nIn the previous post, we looked at how to set up the Windows Admin Center. In this post, we will take a look at what the setup performed under the hood.\r\n\r\nThere are various actions that are performed when installing the Windows Admin Center in the Azure portal. The primary actions are:\r\n\r\n - Updating the NSG (Network Security Group) for the VM to open inbound and outbound traffic\r\n - Installation of the relevant extension\r\n\r\nLet's look at these in detail.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/1647382583623110376c860.png\" alt=\"Installation Notifications\">\r\n\r\n## Extension Added ##\r\n\r\nThe setup installs the extension for the Admin Center as shown below. The **name** of the extension is \"AdminCenter and the **type** of the extension is \"Microsoft.AdminCenter.AdminCenter\". Make sure that the status is set to \"Provisioning succeeded\". If not, then you won't be able to connect to the Windows Admin Center.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/16473828796231115f03049.png\" alt=\"Extension for Admin Center\">\r\n\r\n## Outbound rule added in the NSG ##\r\n\r\nNext, navigate to the NSG of the VM and look at the outbound rules. You will find that the setup added an outbound rule allowing the TCP traffic on port 443 i.e. HTTPS to the Service Tag for Windows Admin Center. The priority is set to the smallest i.e. 100 so that this rule will be evaluated first.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/1647383471623113afbfbd7.png\" alt=\"Outbound rule\">\r\n\r\n## Inbound rule added in the NSG ##\r\n\r\nNext, navigate to the NSG of the VM and look at the inbound rules. If you selected, the setup opened the management port e.g. 6516 for Windows Admin Center connectivity to the VM for any protocol, any source, and any destination. The priority is set to the smallest i.e. 100 so that this rule will be evaluated first.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This is only good for testing. In a production scenario, you should either restrict this rule to a particular IP address or make sure you have connectivity to the virtual network where the VM is deployed.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/1647383498623113ca4332d.png\" alt=\"Inbound rule\">\r\n\r\n## Communication details ##\r\n\r\nTraffic from the Azure portal to Windows Admin Center running on your VM uses HTTPS. Therefore all traffic is encrypted. Your Azure VM is managed using PowerShell and WMI over WinRM.\r\n\r\n## Implementation details ##\r\n\r\nAs we saw Windows Admin Center is installed via an extension on the VM. From official documentation this is how the extension provides the functionality: This extension connects to an external service that manages certificates and DNS records so that you can easily connect to your VM. Each Azure VM that uses the Windows Admin Center extension gets a public DNS record that Microsoft maintains in Azure DNS. We hash the record name with a salt to anonymize the VM's IP address when saving it in DNS - the IP addresses aren't saved in plain text in DNS. This DNS record is used to issue a certificate for Windows Admin Center on the VM, enabling encrypted communication with the VM.\r\n\r\nReference: <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows-server\/manage\/windows-admin-center\/azure\/manage-vm\" target=\"_blank\">Use Windows Admin Center in the Azure portal to manage a Windows Server VM<\/a>\r\n\r\nNow that we know how it works, in the next post, we will start working with the Windows Admin Center to manage our servers.",

In this blog, we will look at setting it up in the Azure portal.\r\n\r\n## Setup ##\r\n\r\nThe setup for Windows Admin Center is very easy and most of the stuff is automated for you. Just navigate to the VM after ensuring that it meets the pre-requisites (as detailed in the previous blog). It can only be from one of these OS: Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2019 or Windows Server 2022 and needs to have at least 3 GiB of memory. Right now it is available only in the Azure public cloud.\r\n\r\nFollow these steps to set it up:\r\n\r\n 1. Under settings, navigate to the option for \"Windows Admin Center\" as shown below.\r\n 2. Select the Inbound port for connectivity to the Windows Admin Center. Also, select the first check box for opening inbound connectivity to this port. **NOTE**: This is only required if you don't have connectivity to the virtual network of the VM. Select the second check box to open the outbound connectivity for Windows Admin Center to install.\r\n 3. Once selections are made, click on the Install button.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/164738159262310c58a433d.png\" alt=\"Windows Admin Center Setup\">\r\n\r\nThat's all there is to the setup. Next, we will see what it does under the hood and how to connect to and work with the Windows Admin Center.",

If you are managing Azure infrastructure and also performing server management then you need to go to the Azure portal daily and also need to log into the VMs from time to time. What if you can perform both activities from just one area without the need to log into the VM. This is where the **Windows Admin Center** comes into the picture.\r\n\r\n**Windows Admin Center** is now available directly in the Azure portal for Windows server VMs. It helps you manage various aspects of the server without requiring you to log into the VM itself via RDP (remote desktop) or remote into it via PowerShell.\r\n\r\n## Cost ##\r\n\r\nThere is no cost to using the Windows Admin Center in the Azure portal.\r\n\r\n## Functionality support ##\r\n\r\nAt the time of writing of this post, the below functionality is supported:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Certificates<\/li>\r\n<li>Devices<\/li>\r\n<li>Events<\/li>\r\n<li>Files and file sharing<\/li>\r\n<li>Firewall<\/li>\r\n<li>Installed apps<\/li>\r\n<li>Local users and groups<\/li>\r\n<li>Performance Monitor<\/li>\r\n<li>PowerShell<\/li>\r\n<li>Processes<\/li>\r\n<li>Registry<\/li>\r\n<li>Remote Desktop<\/li>\r\n<li>Roles and features<\/li>\r\n<li>Scheduled tasks<\/li>\r\n<li>Services<\/li>\r\n<li>Storage<\/li>\r\n<li>Updates<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n## Pre-requisities ##\r\n\r\nTo be able to install the Windows Admin Center in Azure, you need to ensure the following:\r\n\r\n - The OS of the VM should be Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2019, or Windows Server 2022\r\n - At least 3 GiB of memory\r\n - Be in any region of an Azure public cloud (it's not supported in Azure China, Azure Government, or other non-public clouds)\r\n\r\nThere are also **networking requirements** to allow the traffic:\r\n\r\n - Outbound internet access or an outbound port rule allowing HTTPS traffic to the Windows Admin Center service tag\r\n - An inbound port rule if using a public IP address to connect to the VM (not recommended)\r\n\r\nNote that the inbound rule is only required when using the Public IP address. If you are connected to the virtual network and have connectivity to the VM then the inbound rule is not required. These rules are auto-created when enabling the Windows Admin Center.\r\n\r\n## Requirements for connecting VM ##\r\n\r\nThe VM or laptop you will use to connect to the Windows Admin Center (via Azure portal), also has a couple of requirements:\r\n\r\n - You should be using a modern browser. Officially supported browsers are Edge and Chrome.\r\n - Either connectivity via the Public IP or access to the virtual network that's connected to the VM. The latter is the recommended and more secure approach.\r\n\r\nIn the next post, we will set it up and will also take a look under the hood.",

		"body": "You want to control access to Recovery Services Vault and what kind of operations are allowed on the same, you can now do so using the **Resource Guard**. It is another resource in Azure that you can \r\n\r\n## Scenario and Permissions ##\r\n\r\nLet's assume that there are two people at your organization. One who is responsible for the security and another who is responsible for performing backup-related operations. The security wants to limit the backup administrator's operations. Let's classify these people into two roles:\r\n\r\n 1. **Backup Admin** - He is the owner of the Recovery Services Vault and needs to perform various operations.\r\n 2. **Security Admin** - He is the gatekeeper of the critical operations that occur on the vault and controls permissions that the Backup admin needs to perform his job. \r\n\r\n**Permissions on the Resource Guard** - The Security admin needs to be the owner of the Resource Guard. The Backup admin must not have any permission to the Resource Guard.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Caveats ##\r\n\r\nBelow are some of the caveats that you should be aware of:\r\n\r\n - The Backup admin must not have Contributor permissions to the Resource Guard in any scenario. The Resource Guard must be owned by a different user than the backup admin.\r\n - You can place Resource Guard in a subscription or tenant different from the one containing the Recovery Services vault to provide better protection.\r\n - This feature is currently supported for Recovery Services vaults only and not available for Backup vaults.\r\n - Ensure that your subscriptions containing the Recovery Services vault as well as the Resource Guard (in different subscriptions or tenants) are registered to use Microsoft.RecoveryServices provider.\r\n\r\n## Resource Guard Creation ##\r\n\r\nJust search for \"Resource Guard\" in the search box on the Azure portal and navigate to the section. Click on the \"+ Create\" button to create a new Resource Guard. Fill in the name and other defaults and hit Create. That's it. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/164755043562339fe30ffee.png\" alt=\"Resource Guard Creation\">\r\n\r\nNavigate to the resource guard resource once ready.\r\n\r\n## Enabling and Disabling Operations in Resource Guard ##\r\n\r\nFollow the below steps to enable\/disable the protected operations. The numbers correspond to the numbers in the screenshot.\r\n\r\n 1. Navigate to your Resource Guard resource. Then navigate to the properties section.\r\n 2. Provide a description. This would appear in the vaults that are protected using this Resource Guard.\r\n 3. Enable and Disable the protected operations next as shown below.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/16475508836233a1a3173cd.png\" alt=\"Properties of the Resource Guard\">\r\n\r\n## Adding Backup admin as Reader on the Resource Guard ##\r\n\r\nTo enable MUA on a vault, the backup admin of the vault must have a Reader role on the Resource Guard or subscription containing the Resource Guard. Grant the Reader role to the backup admin user from the \"Role assignments\" under the \"Access control (IAM)\" for the Resource Guard resource.\r\n\r\n## Enabling Multi-User Authorization on the Recovery Services Vault ##\r\n\r\nTo set up the Multi-User Authorization on the Recovery Services Vault, navigate to the vault and link it to the Resource Guard resource. To do this navigate to the properties of the vault and select the \"Update\" link under the Multi-User Authorization setting.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/16475511876233a2d3d09f3.png\" alt=\"Multi-User Authorization Setting\">\r\n\r\nNext, select the check box for the \"Protect with Resource Guard\" and select the radio button for the \"Select Resource Guard\". To select the actual resource for the Resource Guard, click on the \"Select Resource Guard\" link.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/16475513316233a363659d3.png\" alt=\"Multi-User Authorization Setting - Details\">\r\n\r\nIn the next blade, select your directory and then the resource guard resource under that from the list. Hit select and then Save in the previous blade. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/16475513356233a367d62f1.png\" alt=\"Selecting the Resource Guard for the Vault\">\r\n\r\nThis should set it up for you. Now the operations you disabled can't be performed on the recovery services vault by the backup admin.\r\n\r\n## Authorize critical (protected) operations ##\r\n\r\nIf for any reason you want to allow the critical i.e. protected operations then the recommended approach is to leverage Privileged Identity Management (PIM) and have the backup admin elevate their access from Reader to a Contributor on the Resource Guard resource. An alternative is to manually update these role assignments on the Resource Guard resource. PIM is the recommended approach as it time bounds the authorization providing just-in-time (JIT) access that is auto-revoked after allowed time.\r\n\r\n**Official documentation link**: <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/backup\/multi-user-authorization\" target=\"_blank\">Multi-user authorization using Resource Guard<\/a>",

		"body": "When you try to modify the SWAP disk or work with the temporary disk and want to change the mount point and related configurations. For example, you may want to change the default mount point of \"\/mnt\" to \"\/mnt\/resources\". The issue we have seen is that the changes work but only till you restart. Once you restart the VM then the configurations are reverted and the issue still persists. You always want to restart the VM to verify that the configurations stay as per your requirements after the reboot.\r\n\r\nWhen searching online the official documentation takes you here: <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/troubleshoot\/azure\/virtual-machines\/swap-file-not-recreated-linux-vm-restart\" target=\"_blank\">Swap file is not re-created after a Linux VM restarts<\/a>. Make sure you have reviewed that and have tried the steps in that link. \r\n\r\n## General Relevant Linux Commands ##\r\n\r\nBelow commands are very helpful when troubleshooting this type of issues to check various configurations:\r\n\r\n 1. ***df -Th*** - This allows you to check the drives i.e. mapped formatted and partitioned drives. This command displays information about total space and available space on a file system formatted in a table.\r\n 2. ***free -h*** - This command allows you to check the memory and swap space. It shows you total, used, shared, cache, and available memory.\r\n 3. ***swapon -s*** - This command is used to check the swap status.\r\n 4. ***cat \/etc\/fstab*** - This shows you the content of the fstab in the \"\/etc\" directory. This is the Linux system's filesystem table. This is a configuration table designed to ease the burden of mounting and unmounting file systems to a machine.\r\n 5. ***fdisk -l*** - This is for format disk. It is a dialog-driven command in Linux used for creating and manipulating disk partition table. \"-l\" option is used to list all disk partitions.\r\n 6. ***lsblk*** - This command lists information about all available or the specified block devices.\r\n\r\nUse these commands to view the current state of your VM disks and to validate the settings.\r\n\r\n## The working fix ##\r\n\r\nIf your issue still persists then try the steps below.\r\n\r\n**Step 1** - Create the directory where you want to mount the temp (or ephemeral) disk\r\n\r\n    mkdir \/mnt\/resource\r\n\r\n**Step 2** - Create the configuration file for custom ephemeral disk mount in the cloud configuration daemon folder.\r\n\r\n    touch \/etc\/cloud\/cloud.cfg.d\/00-custom-ephemeral-mount.cfg\r\n\r\n**Step 3** - Update the contents of the file by using the below command.\r\n\r\n    echo \"mounts:\r\n    - [\"ephemeral0\", \"\/mnt\/resource\"]\" >> \/etc\/cloud\/cloud.cfg.d\/00-custom-ephemeral-mount.cfg\r\n\r\n**Step 4** - Edit the \/etc\/waagent.conf file and change the mount point over there using \"string editing\" tool command. Waagent is the Azure Agent configuration file.\r\n\r\n    sed -i 's\/ResourceDisk.Format=n\/ResourceDisk.Format=y\/g' \/etc\/waagent.conf\r\n\r\n**Step 5** - Per the application\/database requirements allocate the swap size in \/etc\/waagent.conf file. Search and update the below line as per your requirements\r\n\r\n    ResourceDisk.SwapSizeMB=x\r\n    #Replace x with your required Swap size in MBs e.g. ResourceDisk.SwapSizeMB= 2048MB\r\n\r\n**Step 6** - Reboot the server and validate the settings.\r\n\r\nThis should fix your settings.

Just run the below commands (as a user with root authorization) to restart the ***saphostexec*** process:\r\n\r\n    .\/saphostexec -restart \r\n\r\nNow validate the integration status again by running the below commands:\r\n\r\n    cd \/usr\/sap\/hostctrl\/exe\r\n    .\/saposcol -d\r\n    dump ccm\r\n\r\nThe status should now be set to True for the \"Enhanced Monitoring Access\". \r\n\r\n## Problem with the Easy Fix ##\r\n\r\nThe problem that you may encounter is that when you reboot the VM, there are chances that the status can again switch back to False. The potential reason for this is that the SAP OS Collector becomes ready first before the Azure Enhanced Monitoring agent becomes ready. This causes the issue as the SAP OS Collector reports that the extension is not available even though it is installed. This is why restarting the host agent fixes the issue temporarily. \r\n\r\n## Permanent Resolution ##\r\n\r\nThe recommendation is to increase the Azure Extension wait time to **6 minutes**. To set the wait time to 6 minutes, the below environment is needed to be set.\r\n\r\n    SAPOSCOL_AZURE_EXTENSION_WAITTIME=360\r\n\r\nRun the below command to set the environment variable:\r\n\r\n    echo \"export SAPOSCOL_AZURE_EXTENSION_WAITTIME=360\" >> \/etc\/profile\r\n\r\nThis would update the system-wide profile.\r\n\r\nLet us know if this fixed your issue.

		"body": "In the previous blog post, we saw how to install the enhanced monitoring extension for SAP workloads in Azure. We looked at various caveats linked to the installation and pre-requisites etc. You can view that post here: <a href=\"https:\/\/harvestingclouds.com\/post\/installing-enhanced-monitoring-agent-for-sap-workloads-in-azure\/\" target=\"_blank\">Installing Enhanced Monitoring Agent for SAP workloads in Azure<\/a>. In this post, we are going to troubleshoot the extension-related common issues for SAP workloads in Azure.\r\n\r\n## 1. Checking the pre-requisites ##\r\n\r\nAs discussed in the previous post, ensure that the below pre-requisites are in place before you start:\r\n\r\n - This extension needs internet access to the URL \"management.azure.com\". If this is not set up or you have locked the access, please ensure that you open this access in your environment. \r\n - If you have already had an older version of the extension already installed, make sure to uninstall the older VM extension before switching between the standard and the new version of the Azure Extension for SAP.\r\n - Make sure you are using SAP Host Agent 7.21 PL 47 or higher.\r\n - You have SUSE SLES 15 or higher. Or you have Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.1 or higher.\r\n - You are using Azure Ultra Disk or Standard Managed Disks for your SAP workloads\r\n\r\n## 2. Validating the extension is installed successfully or not ##\r\n\r\nRun the below command to search for the enhanced monitoring extension-related files. \r\n\r\n    ls -al \/var\/lib\/waagent\/ | grep AzureCAT\r\n\r\nThere should be 3 processing that should be installed:\r\n\r\n - Microsoft.AzureCAT.AzureEnahncedMonitoring.MonitorX64Linux_xxxxxx.zip\r\n - Microsoft.AzureCAT.AzureEnahncedMonitoring.MonitorX64Linux.xx.manifest.xml\r\n - Microsoft.AzureCAT.AzureEnahncedMonitoring.MonitorX64Linux-version\r\n\r\nThe output should look something like the below:\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/16474607316232417b546d3.png\" alt=\"Azure Enahnced Monitoring Files\">\r\n\r\n## 3. Validating the extension process is up and running or not ##\r\n\r\nCommand (requires sudo):\r\n\r\n    ps -ax | grep AzureCAT\r\n\r\nThe output should have an entry for the relevant process running as shown below:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/16474609136232423169a20.png\" alt=\"Azure CAT Process\">\r\n\r\n## 4. Check Enhanced Monitoring status in SAP OS Collector ##\r\n\r\nRun the below commands (may required sudo access):\r\n\r\n    cd \/usr\/sap\/hostctrl\/exe\r\n    .\/saposcol -d\r\n    dump ccm\r\n\r\nScroll down and check the output:\r\n**Required result**: The Enhanced Monitoring Access should have TRUE in front of it and the output will contain various metrics. If not then keep following the post for troubleshooting tips.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/1647461596623244dc5deb0.png\" alt=\"Enhanced Monitoring Access - Correct Configs\">\r\n\r\n## 5. Validating the Extension is sending metrics ##\r\n\r\nValidate the extension by running the below command from inside the SAP VM:\r\n\r\n    curl http:\/\/127.0.0.1:11812\/azure4sap\/metrics\r\n\r\nThis should output various metrics. If it doesn't then the extension is not working and you need to troubleshoot further.\r\n\r\n## 6. Validating and Fixing the Extension ##\r\n\r\nThis step resolves most of the issues. Test the extension by just running the below cmdlet.\r\n\r\n    Test-AzVMAEMExtension -ResourceGroupName \"Your-Resource-Group-Name\" -VMName \"Your-VM-Name\"\r\n\r\nThe PowerShell cmdlet will deploy\/redeploy the extension and fix any configuration issues. You might have to wait up to one hour until all counters start showing up.\r\n\r\n**Reboot** the VM once and validate the extension again using the previous steps.\r\n\r\n## 7. Still Having issues ##\r\n\r\nIf you are still having issues, then try this subsequent blog for a fix for a common issue: <a href=\"https:\/\/harvestingclouds.com\/post\/enhanced-monitoring-agent-for-sap-workloads-in-azure-fix-for-a-common-issue\/\" target=\"_blank\">Enhanced Monitoring Agent for SAP workloads in Azure - Fix for a common issue<\/a>\r\n\r\n## References ##\r\n\r\nTroubleshooting SAP note: 2191498 - SAP on Linux with Azure: Enhanced Monitoring - SAP ONE Support Launchpad.\r\n\r\nLink: <a href=\"https:\/\/launchpad.support.sap.com\/#\/notes\/2191498\" target=\"_blank\">https:\/\/launchpad.support.sap.com\/#\/notes\/2191498<\/a>\r\n",

In this scenario, we pull all VMs from a single or multiple resource groups. The resource group is selected either based on the wildcard match or you can specify a particular resource group name as well. Each VM is then checked if this is Linux or Windows. Make sure that all the VMs have SAP workloads before proceeding with the installation. You can also uninstall the extension if it is not aplicable on any of the VM later.\r\n\r\nThe script sample is also provided below for your easy reference.\r\n\r\n    <# \t\r\n     .NOTES\r\n    \t==============================================================================================\r\n    \tFile:\t\tInstall-MonitoringExtensionInLoop.ps1\r\n    \t\r\n    \tPurpose:\tTo Install Monitoring Extension In Loop\r\n    \t\t\t\t\t\r\n    \tVersion: \t1.0.0.0 \r\n    \r\n    \tAuthor:\t    Aman Sharma\r\n     \t==============================================================================================\r\n     .SYNOPSIS\r\n    \tInstalls monitoring extension in loop on Linux VMs\r\n      \r\n     .DESCRIPTION\r\n    \tThis script is used to Installs monitoring extension in loop on Linux VMs\r\n    \t\t\r\n     .EXAMPLE\r\n    \tC:\\PS>  .\\Install-MonitoringExtensionInLoop.ps1\r\n    \t\r\n    \tDescription\r\n    \t-----------\r\n    \tThis command executes the script with default parameters.\r\n         \r\n     .INPUTS\r\n        None.\r\n    \r\n     .OUTPUTS\r\n        None.\r\n    \t\t   \r\n     .LINK\r\n    \thttps:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/virtual-machines\/workloads\/sap\/deployment-guide#2ad55a0d-9937-4943-9dd2-69bc2b5d3de0\r\n    #>\r\n    \r\n    #Inputs\r\n    $subscriptionName = \"you-subscription-name\"\r\n    \r\n    #Adding Azure Account and Subscription\r\n    $env = Get-AzEnvironment -Name \"AzureCloud\"\r\n    Connect-AzAccount -Environment $env\r\n    Set-AzContext -SubscriptionName $subscriptionName\r\n    \r\n    #Selecting all RGs that begins with the text.

Ensure that you factor these external factors into your solution and its related SLAs. E.g. for Azure Site Recovery (ASR) the SLA from Microsoft is very less, but your internal department may need to take additional steps post and pre-failover via ASR. You will need to factor these into your internal department's SLA for the service.\r\n\r\nA general rule of thumb is to simulate failure and check how much time it takes for your solution or services to recover from the failure. Add some reasonable (and proportional) buffer to the observed times to formulate the internal SLAs. Ensure that any external factors, human errors, or one-time issues are not affecting these numbers during such exercises.\r\n\r\nHopefully, this helps you in better designing solutions in the cloud.

		"category": "Azure",
		"body": "When you start designing your solutions in Microsoft Azure for high availability, you think of **Availability Zones**. Within a region, these are physically separate locations that are tolerant to local failures. For your business-critical workloads, availability zones help you achieve resiliency and reliability. \r\n\r\n## Need for identifying the right numbers ##\r\n\r\nThe biggest caveat with Availability Zones is that they don't correspond to a specific location within a region. These are enumerated when you create a subscription and are different for each subscription (even within the same tenant). Even within a subscription, these are different for each region. \r\n\r\nLet's look at an example. Let's assume you have two subscriptions within the \"East US\" location. One for Dev and another for Prod. Generally, you will see three availability zones, numbered 1, 2, and 3. The location that is referred to as number 1, may or may not be the same location that is referred to as number 1 in the Prod subscription.\r\n\r\nTherefore it is important that for every subscription and for every region you find the optimal zones. \r\n\r\n## How to define optimal Availability Zones ##\r\n\r\nThe most optimal Availability Zone is the one that is the best in the below 2 factors:\r\n\r\n 1. **Latency** - It should have the lowest latency\r\n 2. **Bandwidth** - It should have the highest latency\r\n\r\nNot that these are important when deploying the solution in highly available designs. Another concept related to HA design is identifying the primary and the secondary zones.\r\n\r\n - Selecting **primary** Availability Zone - Not that the one with the lowest latency and highest bandwidth should become your primary Availability Zone.\r\n - Selection **secondary** Availability Zone - The next best availability zone becomes the secondary zone.\r\n\r\n## Determining the Optimal Availability Zones ##\r\n\r\nTo determine the Optimal Availability Zones, you want to deploy 3 VMs in your subscription. Each VM should be deployed in a different Availability Zone. Then run the Latency and Bandwidth tests between each pair of VMs. Also, ensure to run the tests in both directions. E.g. from VM1 to VM2 and then from VM2 to VM1. \r\n\r\n## Automated Script ##\r\n\r\nThe whole process for finding the optimal availability zones has been automated. This is now as easy as running the script from the below source:\r\n\r\n - <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/Azure\/SAP-on-Azure-Scripts-and-Utilities\/tree\/main\/AvZone-Latency-Test\" target=\"_blank\">Availability Zone Latency Test Script<\/a>\r\n\r\nThe script should be run from a VM within the Virtual Network of the subscription (for which you are trying to identify the optimal zones). This script automatically creates 3 VMs in 3 different availability zones and then runs the latency and bandwidth tests. In the end, it deletes the VMs and also provides you with a detailed report.\r\n\r\nThe report looks something like this: \r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/16477799956237209b34a38.png\" alt=\"Test Report\">\r\n\r\nThe top table shows you **latency** in micro seconds. Lower the number the better it is. As you can see zone 3 to zone 1 is the lowest latency of 56.1 micro seconds. **Bandwith** is shown in the bottom table and is measured in MBs transferred per second. Higher the number, the better it is. As you can see, zone 1 to zone 3, zone 3 to zone 2, show the highest number of 478 MB\/sec. If you take both latency and bandwidth into consideration then zone 1 and zone 3 are the best combinations for this subscription. \r\n\r\nAlso, this test should be run at least 3 times and at different times of the day to get more in-depth and accurate results.\r\n\r\nChanging an availability zone later is a tedious task. Hopefully, this post helps you determine the right availability zones from the start and lay a good foundation for your environment.\r\n",

Let us know if you are interested and I can share the calculations.\r\n\r\n**Advantages with BYOS**: Other than the cost difference there are two main advantages that you get with BYOS:\r\n\r\n 1. You get direct support from the SUSE support team. With the Pay-as-you-go model, you need to open a ticket with Microsoft, and then when Microsoft support deems that the issue pertains to SUSE OS, then SUSE subject matter expert is involved to help you.\r\n 2. You get extended support for the OS versions that are out of general support.\r\n\r\nThe second advantage itself is huge that even if you need to pay extra you would want that in your enterprise environments.\r\n\r\n## Switching to BYOS from the Portal ##\r\n\r\nYou can switch a VM from PAYG to BYOS directly from the Azure portal. To do this navigate to the VM within the Azure portal and navigate to the Configurations section as shown below. Then in the drop down select the option for \"***SUSE Enterprise Linux***\".

Although, the difference is not huge.\r\n\r\n**Advantages with BYOS**: Other than the cost difference there are two main advantages that you get with BYOS:\r\n\r\n 1. You get direct support from the Red Hat support team. With the Pay-as-you-go model, you need to open a ticket with Microsoft, and then when Microsoft support deems that the issue pertains to RHEL OS, then RHEL subject matter expert is involved to help you.\r\n 2. You get extended support for the OS versions that are out of general support.\r\n\r\nThe second advantage itself is huge that even if you need to pay extra you would want that in your enterprise environments.\r\n\r\n## Switching to BYOS from the Portal ##\r\n\r\nYou can switch a VM from PAYG to BYOS directly from the Azure portal.

There are two types of Azure policies:\r\n\r\n 1. **Built-In** - also called out of the box, that are provided by Microsoft\r\n 2. **Custom** - that you build for your environment as per your policies and standards.\r\n\r\nIt is a best practice to store all the custom policies in a version control system e.g. Azure DevOps repositories. If the policies were built directly within the Azure Policies definitions, then you would want to export all of the policies. Exporting one policy at a time can be time-consuming and also prone to end-user errors. You can leverage the script sample from this blog post to automate exporting all the custom policies in your environment (for all subscriptions).\r\n\r\n## Script location in GitHub ##\r\n\r\nThe complete script to export all the custom Azure policies across various subscriptions, can be found here:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/HarvestingClouds\/PowerShellSamples\/tree\/master\/Scripts\/Export-AllAzureCustomPolicies\" target=\"_blank\">Export-AllAzureCustomPolicies<\/a>\r\n\r\n\r\n## Script working ##\r\n\r\nThe script works by iterating over various subscriptions and then fetching the Azure policies in that subscription.

		"body": "**Availability Zones** is the new concept to increase the availability of an Azure Virtual Machine (VM). It provides different datacenter with independent cooling, power, and network within one Azure Region. If you have an application deployed redundantly across more than one VM, then you definitely want to leverage Availability Zones to increase the availability and SLA of the workload.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, you can't move an Azure VM from a non-availability zone deployment to an availability zone. You also can't switch the zone after deploying the VM into one zone. The script sample in this post, help you address both of these scenarios in an automated manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Word of Caution ##\r\n\r\nThe script works by deleting the VM and then recreating it within an availability zone. If the script errors out in the middle, then you will end up with no VM. The script exports the VM configurations into a JSON file for this situation as a fallback option. But you need to know how to use that to recreate your VM. You should do below two things to ensure you don't run into issues:\r\n\r\n - Try the script first for non-production and non-critical VMs. I recommend creating a dummy\/temporary VM and then trying the script.\r\n - Ensure that there is a backup for any production\/critical VMs before moving these into Availability Zones to ensure you have something to fail back to.\r\n\r\n### Script location in GitHub ###\r\n\r\nYou can view and download the latest version of the script, directly from GitHub here: <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/HarvestingClouds\/PowerShellSamples\/tree\/master\/Scripts\/Move-AzVMToAvailabilityZone\" target=\"_blank\">Move-AzVMToAvailabilityZone.ps1<\/a>\r\n\r\n### Script Working ###\r\n\r\nThe script has a custom function called ***Export-VMConfig***. It uses this function to export the VM configurations into a JSON file. This file serves as a backup (only for the configurations) in case anything goes wrong during the script execution. You can use this to recreate the VM.\r\n\r\nThe script then stops the VM using the ***Stop-AzVM*** command. It then creates a snapshot of the OS disk and then, creates an Azure Disk with Zone information from that snapshot. Then the script performs the same thing for all of the data disks. Then it deletes the Azure VM using the ***Remove-AzVM*** cmdlet. Then it starts building the configurations for the new VM using the ***New-AzVMConfig*** cmdlet. \r\n\r\nThe script reapplies the tags and diagnostic profile information.  Then it sets the OS disk as per the OS of the original VM. Then it adds the data disks. Then it adds NIC(s) and keeps the same NIC as primary. If there is a Public IP from the Basic SKU then the script removes it because it doesn't support zones. \r\n\r\nFinally, the script recreates the VM using the ***New-AzVM*** cmdlet.\r\n\r\n### Manual action after the script execution ###\r\n\r\nAfter the new VM has been validated, I recommend waiting anywhere from 24hrs to a week before cleaning up the residual non-availability zone resources. Once you are ready, delete the older OS and data disks and related snapshots. These should be not attached to any VMs.\r\n\r\nI hope that the script helps you in moving your existing infrastructure to avail the redundancy options provided by the Availability Zones in Azure.\r\n\r\n",

		"body": "With **Availability Zones** there is a new way for the data to be made redundant as well in a zone-aware deployment. This is known as \"**Zone Redundant Storage**\" or **ZRS**. This option replicates the data across different availability zones and therefore protects you against the datacenter level failures. It is highly recommended for the architecture involving highly available (HA) design\/solution.\r\n\r\n## ZRS for Managed Disks ##\r\n\r\nZRS as an option for the managed disk is the new feature that has just been introduced.\r\n\r\nNote that this option is available for: \r\n\r\n - Azure Premium SSDs\r\n - Standard SSDs\r\n\r\nAt the time of writing of this post, this option is only available for the below regions:\r\n\r\n - West Europe  \r\n - North Europe \r\n - West US 2 \r\n - France Central\r\n\r\nWhen you will try to create a new managed disk, while selecting the disk size, you can modify its redundancy option. If you are using one of the region mentioned above, you will view \"Zone-redundant storage\" as the option for the **disk SKU**. You will have the option to select either premium SSD or Standard SSD only.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/1647932669623974fde0111.png\" alt=\"ZRS Option for Managed Disks\">\r\n\r\n## ZRS and GZRS options for Storage Accounts ##\r\n\r\nFor the Storage Accounts, this feature is more widely available across various regions. This feature has been available for some time now for the storage accounts.\r\n\r\nWhen creating new storage accounts, you can select ZRS and GZRS for the storage account data redundancy. These stand for:\r\n\r\n - **ZRS** - Zone-redundant storage - data is replicated across different zones.\r\n - **GZRS** - Geo-zone-redundant storage - this is a mix of GRS and ZRS. In addition to data being replicated across zones, it is also replicated across different geo regions.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/164793267762397505de820.png\" alt=\"ZRS Option for Storage Accounts\">\r\n\r\n## Biggest Advantages ##\r\n\r\nThere are lots of advantages to leveraging ZRS storage redundancy in your solutions. The big ones include:\r\n\r\n - If a virtual machine becomes unavailable in an affected zone, you can continue to work with the disk by mounting it to a virtual machine in a different zone. \r\n - You can also use the ZRS option with shared disks to provide improved availability for clustered or distributed applications E.g. SQL FCI, SAP ASCS\/SCS, or GFS2.\r\n\r\n**References**: \r\n\r\n - <a href=\"https:\/\/azure.microsoft.com\/en-us\/updates\/zone-redundant-storage-zrs-for-azure-disk-storage-now-generally-available\/\" target=\"_blank\">Zone redundant storage (ZRS) for Azure Disk Storage<\/a>\r\n - <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/storage\/common\/storage-redundancy#redundancy-in-the-primary-region\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Storage redundancy in the primary region<\/a>",

The first aspect is the **backup instances**. Here you can view and manage various backup instances filtered by your datasource type. The key thing to note is that the view and various columns that are shown automatically update based on the datasource type selected. You can also set up new backup and \/or trigger restore from the existing backup by using the buttons at the top of the page. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/1648095666623bf1b2aca48.png\" alt=\"Backup Instances\">\r\n\r\nNext section \"Backup Policies\" let's you view and manage backup policies across your environment. You can make updates as required. You can also create new backup policies as well.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/1648095675623bf1bb25e2f.png\" alt=\"Backup Policies\">\r\n\r\nThe third and the last section in this category is the ability to view Vaults (both backup and recovery services vaults) across your environment. You can navigate to those vaults by clicking on the corresponding row. You can also create a new vault from here.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/1648095681623bf1c1cccca.png\" alt=\"Vaults\">\r\n\r\n\r\n## 2. Monitoring and Reporting ##\r\n\r\nThe monitoring and reporting section helps you with supporting your backup infrastructure. It has the following three sections:\r\n\r\n 1. **Backup jobs** - shows you all the backup-related jobs, across your environment.\r\n 2. **Alerts** - shows you all alerts related to your backup data across different vaults.\r\n 3. **Metrics** - provide monitoring of various metrics on the backup data. The main two metrics available are \"Backup health events\" and \"Restore health events\".\r\n 4. **Backup reports** - detailed reporting into the backup data linked to log analytics.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/1648096240623bf3f0133b7.png\" alt=\"Backup jobs\">\r\n\r\n## 3. Policy and Compliance ##\r\n\r\nThe policy and compliance section is all about the governance of the backup data. The main sub-sections in this section are:\r\n\r\n 1. **Backup compliance** - it shows you the compliance of various resources related to backup based on the policies and initiatives applied in your environment. It looks for the backup category for the policies and initiatives.\r\n 2. **Azure policies for backup** - All the Azure policies, filtered by the \"backup\" category. You can also view the initiatives here by updating the drop down based filters.\r\n 3. **Protectable datasources** - These are all the resources that can be protected. \r\n\r\nProtectable datasources is very important section as it helps you easily find all the resources for which you haven't configured the protection. Filter by datasource type to view the resources that can be protected for that type. E.g. in the image below it shows you all the VMs that can be protected via the backup services.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/1648096247623bf3f789f98.png\" alt=\"Protectable datasources\">\r\n\r\nThat is all there is to it. Explore all these sections one by one and play around with different options available in each. Backup Center is very powerful in unifying the backup experience and providing a single pane of glass to monitor and manage your backups.\r\n\r\n**References**: \r\n\r\n - <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/backup\/backup-center-overview\" target=\"_blank\">Overview of Backup center<\/a>\r\n - <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/backup\/backup-center-support-matrix\" target=\"_blank\">Support matrix for Backup center<\/a>",

It unifies the backup data from various vaults across different subscriptions within your tenant.\r\n\r\n## Navigating to the Backup Center ##\r\n\r\nTo navigate to the **Backup Center**, just go to all Services and just search for it. Or better approach is to find it by searching for it at the top search bar. Once launched you get the view shown in the below image. Note at the middle top section that you can filter the data being shown by following categories:\r\n\r\n - Subscription (across your tenant that you have access to)\r\n - Resource Group\r\n - Location\r\n - Type (type of the backup data)\r\n - Vault (where it is being protected)\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/1648000888623a7f78dec92.png\" alt=\"Backup Center homepage\">\r\n\r\nThe Datasource types that you can manage directly from the Backup Center include:\r\n\r\n - Azure Virtual machines\r\n - SQL in Azure VM\r\n - Azure Files (Azure Storage)\r\n - SAP HANA in Azure VM\r\n - Azure Disks\r\n - Azure Blobs (Azure Storage)\r\n - Azure Datacenter for PostgreSQL servers\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/1648000897623a7f8116ec9.png\" alt=\"Datasource type\">\r\n\r\n## Allowed Actions ##\r\n\r\nLet's check out what all you can do with the Backup Center.\r\n\r\n<style>\r\n  table,\r\n  th,\r\n  td {\r\n    border: 1px solid black;\r\n    border-collapse: collapse;\r\n  }\r\n<\/style>\r\n<table>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>\r\n      <b>Category<\/b>\r\n    <\/td>\r\n    <td>\r\n      <b>Actions<\/b>\r\n    <\/td>\r\n  <\/tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>\r\n      <b>Monitoring<\/b>\r\n    <\/td>\r\n    <td>\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <li>View all Jobs<\/li>\r\n        <li>View all backup instances<\/li>\r\n        <li>View all backup policies<\/li>\r\n        <li>View all vaults<\/li>\r\n        <li>View Azure Monitor alerts at scale<\/li>\r\n        <li>View Azure Backup metrics and write metric alert rules<\/li>\r\n      <\/ul>\r\n    <\/td>\r\n  <\/tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>\r\n      <b>Actions<\/b>\r\n    <\/td>\r\n    <td>\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <li>Configure backup<\/li>\r\n        <li>Restore Backup Instance<\/li>\r\n        <li>Create vault<\/li>\r\n        <li>Create backup policy<\/li>\r\n        <li>Execute on-demand backup for a backup instance<\/li>\r\n        <li>Stop backup for a backup instance<\/li>\r\n        <li>Execute cross-region restore job from Backup center<\/li>\r\n      <\/ul>\r\n    <\/td>\r\n  <\/tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>\r\n      <b>Insights<\/b>\r\n    <\/td>\r\n    <td>\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <li>View Backup Reports<\/li>\r\n      <\/ul>\r\n    <\/td>\r\n  <\/tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>\r\n      <b>Governance<\/b>\r\n    <\/td>\r\n    <td>\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <li>View and assign built-in and custom Azure Policies under category Backup<\/li>\r\n        <li>View datasources not configured for backup<\/li>\r\n      <\/ul>\r\n    <\/td>\r\n  <\/tr>\r\n<\/table>\r\n\r\n## Unsupported Scenario ##\r\n\r\nCurrently, the only unsupported scenario is updating the vault settings at scale.

Before performing any major activity in your environment, you will want to take an on-demand backup. This helps you to have a fallback option if anything goes wrong during the activity. To extend the expiry date you may want to update the policy temporarily as the on-demand backup for SAP HANA on Azure VMs, doesn't allow the feature to specify the expiry date.\r\n\r\nThe script I present in this post automates the triggering of this on-demand backup for multiple SAP HANA databases. The script takes the name of VMs and related SAP HANA database information in a csv file as input.\r\n\r\n**NOTE**: As the feature to trigger the SAP HANA database is available only with the CLI cmdlet, we are using the CLI command. Please ensure that you have AZ CLI also installed in your environment by following the instructions here: <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/cli\/azure\/install-azure-cli\" target=\"_blank\">How to install the Azure CLI<\/a>.\r\n\r\n## Script location ##\r\n\r\nThe latest version of the script can be found in GitHub here: <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/HarvestingClouds\/PowerShellSamples\/tree\/master\/Scripts\/Trigger-AzSAPHANAOnDemandBackup\" target=\"_blank\">Trigger-AzSAPHANAOnDemandBackup<\/a>\r\n\r\nThe input CSV file sample is also located at the same location. Use this file to provide the VM names and related SAP HANA database information as an input to the script. Update the path to this file in the script input variables. Update this file as per your environment.\r\n\r\n## Script Working ##\r\n\r\nThe script starts by checking if the input config file (with VM names) exists or not. If not, then the script prints the message to check the path and exit. It then imports the CSV file. Then it sets the context to the right recovery services vault and starts iterating through the VMs. Then it sets the item and container variables as below.\r\n\r\n    $itemName = \"SAPHanaDatabase;$instanceName;$databaseName\"\r\n    $containerName = \"VMAppContainer;Compute;$VMResourceGroup;$vmName\"\r\n\r\nFinally, it triggers the on-demand backup using the below az cli command.\r\n\r\n    az backup protection backup-now --resource-group $rgOfVault --item-name $itemName --vault-name $vaultName --container-name $containerName --backup-type Full --output table\r\n\r\nI hope this script helps you save lots of time during on-demand backup creation. If you have any improvements you would like to see in the script feel free to provide that as a comment here or a pull request on GitHub.",

You will want to test all of these route tables and check if the \"*Next Hop*\" is as per the route tables set by you or not. This could prove to be a tedious task if done manually. I have automated this task using PowerShell scripting. I am sharing the sample in this post. \r\n\r\n**NOTE**: You should enable Network Watcher in your environment for this script sample to work. Also, note that you need to enable the Network watcher only in the region where your resources exist.\r\n\r\n## Script location ##\r\n\r\nThe latest version of the script can be found in GitHub here: \r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/HarvestingClouds\/PowerShellSamples\/tree\/master\/Scripts\/Test-NetworkWatcherRouteNextHop\" target=\"_blank\">Test-NetworkWatcherRouteNextHop<\/a>.\r\n\r\nA sample input CSV file is also located at the same location.\r\n\r\n## Script Working ##\r\n\r\nFor the script to work, make sure that you have filled the input CSV file as per your environment. In every test, there will be a source and a destination for the communication pair. The script primary looks for the below information from the csv file:\r\n\r\n 1. **SourceSubscription** - The subscription for the source.\r\n 2. **SourceRG** - The resource group of the source VM\r\n 3. **SourceVMName** - Name of the source VM\r\n 4. **Source IP - Indicative** - Actual IP address of the source VM. Please ignore the \"indicative\" text\r\n 5. **DestinationIP-Actual** - Actual IP address of the destination VM\r\n 6. **SourceLocation** - Azure region location of the source VM\r\n\r\n**NOTE**: Within the script update the Network Watcher names as per your primary and secondary regions in Azure where \"***Get-AzNetworkWatcher***\" cmdlet is used. E.g. to fetch the Network Watcher in the East US 2 region the command used is as below.\r\n\r\n    $nw = Get-AzNetworkWatcher -Name NetworkWatcher_eastus2 -ResourceGroupName NetworkWatcherRG\r\n\r\nThe script then fetches the VM using the ***Get-AzVM*** cmdlet.\r\n\r\n    $vm = Get-AzVM -Name $SourceVMName -ResourceGroupName $SourceVMResourceGroupName\r\n\r\nFinally, it executes the test by using the ***Get-AzNetworkWatcherNextHop*** command.\r\n\r\n    $nextHop = Get-AzNetworkWatcherNextHop -NetworkWatcher $nw -TargetVirtualMachineId $vm.Id -SourceIPAddress $SourceVMIPAddress -DestinationIPAddress $DestinationIPAddress\r\n\r\nTo get the results it uses the output of the above command.\r\n\r\n    $eachVM.NextHopType = $nextHop.NextHopType\r\n    $eachVM.IPAddressResult = $nextHop.NextHopIpAddress\r\n    $eachVM.RouteTableID = $nextHop.RouteTableId\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can then compare the output with the expected output to check if the test case passed or failed. \r\n\r\nIf you have any improvements you would like to see in the script feel free to provide that as a comment here or a pull request on GitHub.",

Specifically, it uses the filter to match the type to \"***Microsoft.Compute\/virtualMachines***\".\r\n\r\n    $resource.Type -eq \"Microsoft.Compute\/virtualMachines\"\r\n\r\nThen for every VM, it fetches three different types of information and adds each as a separate row to the output CSV:\r\n\r\n 1.

You can find the Index of this series here: <a href=\"https:\/\/harvestingclouds.com\/post\/azure-bastion-series-index\/\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Bastion Series<\/a>.\r\n\r\nIn the previous few posts, we looked at various aspects of the Azure Bastion service. In this post, we will look at various monitoring and alerting capabilities related to Azure Bastion. \r\n\r\n### Monitoring remote sessions ###\r\n\r\nYou can monitor all the remote sessions being facilitated by Azure Bastion. To do this navigate to the Azure Bastion host. Click on the \"Sessions\" under settings. On the right side, you will be able to view all the active sessions. Click on the Refresh button to update the list with any added or removed session.\r\n\r\nNote that in the list you will see many pieces of valuable information. Few important ones are:\r\n\r\n 1. Target Host Name - Hostname of the VM that has an active session.\r\n 2. UserName - User name that was used to connect to the VM.\r\n 3. Protocol - RDP or SSH protocol, that is used to connect to the target VMs (by the Bastion host). It is ssh for Linux and RDP for Windows VMs.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/16172197836064d0c7aa98f.png\" alt=\"Monitoring remote sessions\">\r\n\r\n### Managing remote sessions - Deleting the sessions ###\r\n\r\nIf required, you can delete any session from the list of active sessions. To do this simply right-click on the session name in the list and click on the Delete in the pop-up menu.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/16172197906064d0cedd0d8.png\" alt=\"Option to delete a session\">\r\n\r\nThe person connected to the VM via Azure Bastion will see a prompt similar to the below. Even after a reconnection attempt from this prompt the connection won't be successful. If the end-user wants to connect again then they will have to initiate the connection again from the Azure portal.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/16172197976064d0d59163b.png\" alt=\"Disconnected session\">\r\n\r\n### Monitoring Azure Bastion ###\r\n\r\nThe monitoring capabilities are integrated with Azure Monitor. Navigate to the **Monitor** service in the Azure portal and then click on the \"**Metrics**\" option in the left settings pane. On the right side, set the Scope to the Azure Bastion host, that you want to monitor. Next, select one of the available metrics from the list of Metric dropdown. \r\n\r\nThe options available for Metric are:\r\n\r\n 1. Availability - Bastion communication status \r\n 2. Saturation - Total memory\r\n 3. Saturation - Used CPU\r\n 4. Saturation - Used memory\r\n 5. Traffic - Session count\r\n\r\nThe one shown in the screenshot below is for \"Traffic - **Session count**\".\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/16172198356064d0fb2edca.png\" alt=\"Metrics for Bastion Monitoring\">\r\n\r\n### Creating Alerts on Azure Bastions ###\r\n\r\nFrom the Monitor, you can also create Alerts related to Azure Bastion. This experience is also similar to creating an alert for any other service in Azure. To create a new alert, click on the \"+ New alert rule\" button under the Alert section.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Create alert rule\", select the scope and set it to the Azure Bastion service. Then click on the \"Add condition\" button. This will bring a pop-up blade to \"Configure signal logic\". This is the condition on which the alert will be triggered. Check all the signals available here.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you can select or create an Action Group to send notifications and take actions whenever an alert is triggered.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/16172198416064d101ed680.png\" alt=\"Alerts for Bastion\">",

You can find the Index of this series here: <a href=\"https:\/\/harvestingclouds.com\/post\/azure-bastion-series-index\/\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Bastion Series<\/a>.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier posts, we saw how to set up the Azure Bastion service and how to connect to VMs using this service. In this post, we will see what ports are involved and on which side to allow this communication. That is which ports are involved in the outbound communication between the target VMs and Bastion host and which ports are involved in the inbound communication. You will need this information when dealing with any NSGs or Firewalls.\r\n\r\n### Key Points ###\r\n\r\nAzure Bastion is a fully managed platform PaaS service from Azure that is hardened internally to provide you with secure RDP\/SSH connectivity. You don't need to apply any NSGs on the Azure Bastion subnet. Because Azure Bastion connects to your virtual machines over private IP, you can configure your NSGs to allow RDP\/SSH from Azure Bastion only. This removes the hassle of managing NSGs each time you need to securely connect to your virtual machines.\r\n\r\n**Note**: UDR is not supported on an Azure Bastion subnet. You don\u2019t need to force traffic from an Azure Bastion subnet to Azure Firewall because the communication between Azure Bastion and your VMs is private. Therefore unless you have a complex deployment you will need to define the rules only at the NSG levels.\r\n\r\n#### Inbound rules for the Azure Bastion Subnet ###\r\n\r\n**Note**: These are the rules for the **Inbound** or **Ingress** communication for the Azure Bastion host. These are **applied to** the NSG for the Bastion subnet.\r\n\r\nNavigate to the \"Inbound security rules\" in the NSG and click on the \"+ Add\" button to add individual rules. As a best practice, leave a range of 10 or higher when providing priority to the rules. Ensure that the order is correct and in the required sequence. \r\n\r\nAdd **the rules** for the following:\r\n\r\n 1. Inbound on 443 from the Internet - Allow HTTPS inbound on port 443 for TCP protocol. Use the service tag of \"Internet\" for the Source and \"Any\" for the destination. This rule is required for you to be able to make HTTPS connections to the Azure Bastion host from the Azure portal.\r\n 2. Azure Bastion control plane - Allow 443 for TCP protocol. Use the service tag of \"GatewayManager\" for the Source and \"Any\" for the destination. This rule is required for the Azure Bastion control plane, i.e. Gateway Manager to be able to talk to Azure Bastion\r\n 3. Azure Bastion data plane communication - Allow 443 for TCP protocol. Use the service tag of \"AzureLoadBalancer\" for the Source and \"Any\" for the destination. This rule allows communication between the underlying components of Azure Bastion.\r\n 4. Azure Load Balancer Health probes - Allow 5701 and 8080 for \"Any\" protocol. Use the service tag of \"VirtualNetwork\" for the Source and also \"VirtualNetwork\" for the destination. This rule enables Azure Load Balancer to detect connectivity.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/16172164676064c3d372f83.png\" alt=\"Inbound for the Azure Bastion Subnet\">\r\n\r\n#### Outbound rules for the Azure Bastion Subnet ###\r\n\r\n**Note**: These are the rules for the **Outbound** or **Egress** communication for the Azure Bastion host. These are **applied to** the NSG for the Bastion subnet.\r\n\r\nNavigate to the \"Outbound security rules\" in the NSG and click on the \"+ Add\" button to add individual rules. As a best practice, leave a range of 10 or higher when providing priority to the rules. Ensure that the order is correct and in the required sequence. \r\n\r\nAdd **the rules** for the following:\r\n\r\n 1. Traffic to target VMs - Allow SSH and RDP outbound on ports 22 and 3389 for Any protocol. Use the \"Any\" for the Source and the service tag of \"VirtualNetwork\" for the destination. This rule allows Bastion to be able to connect to target VMs for SSH and RDP connectivity.\r\n 2. Azure Bastion data plane communication - Allow outbound on ports 443 for TCP protocol. Use the \"Any\" for the Source and the service tag of \"AzureCloud\" for the destination. This rule allows outbound communication for the components of Azure Bastion to talk to each other.\r\n 3. Azure Cloud communication - Allow outbound on ports 5701 and 8080 for Any protocol. Use the \"VirtualNetwork\" for the Source and also the service tag of \"VirtualNetwork\" for the destination. This rules is required for Azure Bastion to send diagnostics logs, metering logs, and other information to various public endpoints within Azure cloud.\r\n 4. Internet communication - Allow outbound on port 80 for Any protocol. Use the \"Any\" for the Source and the service tag of \"Internet\" for the destination. This rule is required for session and certificate validation.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/16172164756064c3db1bc20.png\" alt=\"Outbound for the Azure Bastion Subnet\">\r\n\r\n#### Inbound rules for the Target VM's NSG ###\r\n\r\n**Note**: These are the rules for the **Inbound** or **Ingress** communication for the Target VM that you will RDP to via the Bastion host. These are **applied to** the NSG for the subnet of the Target VM or directly to the network interface card of the VM. \r\n\r\nYou will need to allow ports 3389 (RDP) and 22 (SSH) inbound on the target VM. This needs to be allowed for the Bastion host to be able to make the RDP and SSH connections respectively to the target VM.\r\n\r\n**Note**  \r\n\r\n 1. You don't need both ports i.e. 3389 (RDP) and 22 (SSH). You should limit it to either one based on the operating system within the VM. For Windows VMs you will select the 3389 port and for the Linux VMs, you will select port number 22. This is shown as number 4 in the below screenshot.\r\n 2. You should update the Source IP address range to the address range of the Bastion subnet i.e. \"**AzureBastionSubnet**\" subnet only. This is shown as number 5 in the below screenshot.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/16172164676064c3d372f83.png\" alt=\"Inbound for the Target VM\">\r\n\r\nYou can read more about these in the official documentation here: <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/bastion\/bastion-nsg\" target=\"_blank\">Working with NSG access and Azure Bastion<\/a>",

For Windows VMs, you connect via RDP and for Linux VMs you connect via SSH. In both scenarios, you will need to copy and paste the text from the local machine to the remote VM. In Bastion this is managed via the Clipboard manager on the Bastion host.\r\n\r\nBefore you start make sure that you know how to connect to the VMs and various caveats linked to that as we discussed in the earlier posts.\r\n\r\n### Clipboard Access ###\r\n\r\nWhen trying to connect for the first time or trying to connect on a new browser, the Bastion service will request you to allow the Text and Image related clipboard access. I highly recommend allowing this. If you opt to not allow this access then later, you won't be able to share any clipboard with the session.\r\n\r\n**Note**: Only text copy\/paste is supported.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/16171550566063d3f05a651.png\" alt=\"Allow Clipboard access\">\r\n\r\nWhen you are in the remote session, launch the Bastion clipboard access tool palette by selecting the two arrows on the left-center of the session.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/1617171691606414ebdf8a2.png\" alt=\"Pop out option\">\r\n\r\nIn the pop-out window, any text you have copied on the local machine will automatically appear in the text box in this window. You can review or modify the text in this window and the clipboard in the remote VM will be updated automatically. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/1617171699606414f37cae9.png\" alt=\"Clipboard\">\r\n\r\n### Full Screen ###\r\n\r\nAnother very useful option that is available in the pop-out option is to go full screen. Just click on the button as indicated below to enter the full-screen mode. This is recommended when you have to work on the remote VM for a long period of time.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/1617171707606414fb514f6.png\" alt=\"Full Screen Option\">\r\n\r\nPress the Escape button to exit the Full Screen.",

In this post, we will see how to connect to the instances of a Virtual Machine Scale Set (VMSS). Note that in the case of VMSS, Bastion will automatically decide whether to use RDP or SSH based on the operating system of the instance.\r\n\r\nTo start, navigate to your Virtual Machine Scale Set (VMSS) and click on the Instances.

This ensures that the connection opens in a new tab or window and uses the maximum area. If you uncheck this then the connection will open in a new blade to the right and the view will be limited.\r\n 3.

The next entry will update as per the selection here.\r\n 5. Provide the additional information for the selection you made in the previous point. \r\n 6. The advanced settings are optional and can be skipped. This does not relate to all authentication types.\r\n 7. Finally click on the Connect button to connect to the VM\r\n\r\nThe options for **authentication types** are as follows:\r\n\r\n 1. Password - This is to use the normal username and password-based authentication\r\n 2. SSH Private Key - This option is used when you want to provide the key phrase manually\r\n 3. SSH Private Key from Local File - This is to upload the private key file from the local computer. You can optionally provide a passphrase for this.\r\n 4. SSH Private Key from Azure Key Vault - This is to use a private key file that you have previously uploaded to the Azure Key Vault.\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/16171654726063fca09b5cc.png\" alt=\"Connecting via Bastion\">\r\n\r\nOnce you click on the **Connect** button, the SSH session to the VM opens up in a new tab.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/16171655386063fce2774b2.png\" alt=\"Connected VM\">\r\n\r\n**Note**: Almost all the Caveats from the previous blog for RDP to Windows VM also apply to the SSH to Linux VMs.",

In this post, we will look at how to connect to a Windows VM via RDP using the Bastion service.\r\n\r\n### Connecting to the Windows VM via RDP ###\r\n\r\nTo start an RDP connection to a Windows host, navigate to the virtual machine that you want to connect to. Click on the Connect button. In the pop-out option, select the Bastion option. Click on the \"Use Bastion\" button on the next screen.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/16171549706063d39a0fac1.png\" alt=\"Option to connect via Bastion\">\r\n\r\nIn the next screen to \"Connect using Azure Bastion\", enter the credentials for the VM to which you are trying to connect. Keep the check box for \"Open in new window\" checked. If you don't select this checkbox then the RDP session will open in another blade to the right. I prefer to open the RDP session in a new window for maximum screen space.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/16171549776063d3a15cb2c.png\" alt=\"Entering Credentials\">\r\n\r\nYour VM will open in a new tab. You will be able to perform many actions that you can do via direct RDP (with exception of a few).\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/16171549836063d3a7d8a71.png\" alt=\"Connected VM\">\r\n\r\n### Caveats during the connectivity ###\r\n\r\nThere are some caveats when connecting via the Bastion service. Here are a few that I have encountered or was able to generate.\r\n\r\nThe first one is the pop-up blocked alert. When you are trying to connect using the option to open in the new window, then if you have a pop-up blocker enabled and the Azure portal is not whitelisted then you will see the below alert in the portal when trying to connect. The connection will not succeed.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/16171550396063d3df0bde5.png\" alt=\"Pop up blocked\">\r\n\r\n**Solution**: click on the small icon for blocked pop-up in the address bar of the browser, as shown below, and select to Allow the pop-ups from the Azure portal.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/16171550466063d3e6c5171.png\" alt=\"Allowing Pop ups\">\r\n\r\nWhen trying to connect for the first time or trying to connect on a new browser, the Bastion service will request you to allow the Text and Image related clipboard access. I highly recommend allowing this. If you opt to not allow this access then later, you won't be able to share any clipboard with the session.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/16171550566063d3f05a651.png\" alt=\"Text and image clipboard access\">\r\n\r\nIf for any reason the connection is interrupted then you will see a dialog saying \"Disconnected\". You will have the option to **Reconnect** or exit by clicking on the **Close** button.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/16171551196063d42fe0568.png\" alt=\"Disconnected pop up\">\r\n\r\nConnection Error may come e.g. when restarting the VM. It will automatically attempt to reconnect in few seconds. You can also force reconnect by clicking on the \"Reconnect\" button.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/16171551266063d436edb5f.png\" alt=\"Connection Error\">\r\n\r\nAs you can see that using the Bastion service to connect to the Windows VMs is a very easy and straightforward process. In the next post, we will look at how to connect to a Linux VM via SSH using the Bastion service.",

You can find the Index of this series here: <a href=\"https:\/\/harvestingclouds.com\/post\/azure-bastion-series-index\/\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Bastion Series<\/a>.\r\n\r\nIn the previous post, we looked at what the Azure Bastion service is. We discuss its architecture, how it works, key benefits, pricing, etc. In this post, we will look at how to create the Azure Bastion service in the Azure portal.\r\n\r\nAs we noted in the previous post, the Azure Bastion host is linked to a particular virtual network. In this post, when we will perform the deployment, you will notice that the deployment will be done related to a particular virtual network that we will need to select. This should be the virtual network into which your virtual machines are also deployed which you want to RDP or SSH into via the Azure Bastion service.\r\n\r\n### Pre-requisites ###\r\n\r\nBefore you start setting up the Azure Bastion host, you need to have a subnet in your Virtual network where you are deploying it.\r\n\r\n 1. The subnet must be named **AzureBastionSubnet**.\r\n 2. The subnet must be at least **\/26 or larger**.\r\n\r\nIn order to make a connection, the following **roles** are required:\r\n\r\n 1. Reader role on the virtual machine\r\n 2. Reader role on the NIC with private IP of the virtual machine\r\n 3. Reader role on the Azure Bastion resource\r\n\r\n### Creating the Azure Bastion host ###\r\n\r\nTo create a Bastion host, you can navigate to the **Bastions** section in the Azure portal. Click on the \"+ Add\" button to add a new Bastion host.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/16171514666063c5ea66c5f.png\" alt=\"Bastion section\">\r\n\r\nA new blade for \"Create a Bastion\" will open up. In this new blade, provide the details for:\r\n\r\n - Subscription and the Resource Group where you want to deploy the Bastion service.\r\n - Provide a name for the Bastion host and the region where it should be deployed. Note that the region should be the same as where the Virtual Network and the VMs are located.\r\n - Next, select the target Virtual network. It will automatically select the subnet with the name as AzureBastionSubnet. Note that this subnet should have the size as \/27 or larger. If there is no such subnet then you will get an error. \r\n - Next, either create a new public IP address or use an existing public IP for the Bastion host.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/16171514816063c5f962004.png\" alt=\"Create a new Bastion\">\r\n\r\nIn the next screen provide the Tags. Review all the settings and then create the Bastion host. \r\n\r\nThat's all there is to it. Once the deployment is complete we will be ready to leverage this to connect to the other VMs in the virtual network. \r\n\r\nNote that we will not be able to connect to the Bastion host itself. It is a fully managed service and is used under the hood to connect to the VMs via RDP or SSH internally. We will be able to connect to other VMs in the network, over port 443 directly from the Azure portal, directly in the browser.\r\n\r\nIn the next post, we will look at how to connect to VMs using the Azure Bastion host.",

You can find the Index of this series here: <a href=\"https:\/\/harvestingclouds.com\/post\/azure-bastion-series-index\/\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Bastion Series<\/a>.\r\n\r\n### 1. Details about Azure Bastion ###\r\n\r\nAzure Bastion is a fully platform-managed PaaS service that provides RDP\/SSH over TLS i.e. port 443 to all the VMs in the network. Think of this as a managed Jump Box or Jump Server service provided by Microsoft. The service is deployed via a managed host into your virtual network. This host is like a fully managed Jump box and is kept up to date by Microsoft. \r\n\r\nNote that you will need to deploy one host for each of your virtual networks. Using one host, you will be able to connect to all the VMs in the same virtual network. The Bastion host needs a Public IP address. All the rest of the VMs don't need any public IP address.\r\n\r\nHere are key points about Azure Bastion:\r\n\r\n - Azure Bastion provides an integrated platform alternative to manually deploying and managing jump servers or Jump boxes to shield your virtual machines.\r\n - It is a fully platform-managed PaaS service\r\n - Bastion host is provisioned inside your virtual network\r\n - Secure and seamless RDP\/SSH connectivity to your virtual machines directly from the Azure portal over TLS\r\n - Virtual machines do not need a public IP address, agent, or special client software\r\n - One Bastion host is needed per virtual network\r\n - The public IP of the Bastion resource on which RDP\/SSH will be accessed (over port 443)\r\n - You don't need an RDP or SSH client. Use the Azure portal to let you get RDP\/SSH access to your virtual machine directly in the browser.\r\n - Azure Bastion doesn't move or store customer data out of the region it is deployed in.\r\n\r\n\r\n### 2. Shortcomings or Areas of Improvement ###\r\n\r\nThe below features are currently either not available or are not supported:\r\n\r\n - IPv6 is not supported. Azure Bastion supports IPv4 only.\r\n - Only text copy\/paste is supported. Features, such as file copy, are not supported yet.\r\n - It doesn't work with AADJ VM extension-joined machines using Azure AD users.\r\n - Azure Bastion currently supports only en-us-qwerty keyboard layout inside the VM.\r\n\r\n### 3. Architecture - How Azure Bastion works ###\r\n\r\nBastion Hosts are Jump servers that are deployed with a public IP address. These reside at the perimeter of your network. All the other VMs do not need any public IP address. You will be able to connect to the VMs via this Bastion host. The VMs can be deployed in one or many different subnets in the same virtual network. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou need to have a dedicated subnet with the name as AzureBastionSubnet. This subnet must be at least \/27 or larger. This subnet should be deployed before creating the Bastion host.\r\n\r\nYou connect to the Bastion server directly from within the browser on port 443. The Bastion host in turn connects to the VM at port 3389 for RDP and 22 for SSH.\r\n\r\nThe subnet for the Azure Bastion host needs to have connectivity to the rest of the subnets. This is available by default. If you have NSGs then Bastion-related communication should be allowed. We will look at these rules in detail in a later post.\r\n\r\nNote that UDR is not supported on an Azure Bastion subnet. You don\u2019t need to force traffic from an Azure Bastion subnet to Azure Firewall because the communication between Azure Bastion and your VMs is private.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft keeps Azure Bastion hardened and always up to date for you to ensure that it can withstand attacks from outside.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/161713753660638f80c8e4f.png\" alt=\"Azure Bastion Architecture\">\r\n\r\n### 4. Benefits of using Azure Bastion ###\r\n\r\nThere are various benefits of using Azure Bastion. The main one being able to RDP\/SSH to your VMs without exposing them via any public IP address. Below is the list of various benefits of having Azure Bastion in your virtual networks:\r\n\r\n - Secure and seamless RDP and SSH access to your virtual machines\r\n - No Public IP exposure on the VM\r\n - Help limit threats such as port scanning and other types of malware targeting your VMs\r\n - Fully managed, autoscaling, and hardened PaaS service\r\n - Uses a modern HTML5-based web client and standard SSL ports. This makes Firewall and other security rules very easy to manage.\r\n - Existing authentication works i.e. Existing credentials and SSH keys will still be used for connecting to the VMs\r\n - Same single pane of glass experience to connect to all the VMs\r\n - Bastion host servers are designed and configured to withstand attacks. The Azure platform protects against zero-day exploits by keeping the Azure Bastion hardened and always up to date for you.\r\n\r\n### 5. Concurrency Considerations ###\r\n\r\nBoth RDP and SSH are a usage-based protocol. High usage of sessions will cause the bastion host to support a lower total number of sessions. The numbers below assume normal day-to-day workflows.\r\n\r\n<table class=\"table\">\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>Workload Type*<\/th>\r\n<th>Limit**<\/th>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<\/thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Light<\/td>\r\n<td>100<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Medium<\/td>\r\n<td>50<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Heavy<\/td>\r\n<td>5<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<\/tbody>\r\n<\/table>\r\n\r\nThese workload types are defined here: <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows-server\/remote\/remote-desktop-services\/remote-desktop-workloads\" target=\"_blank\">Remote Desktop workloads<\/a>\r\n\r\n### 6. Pricing ###\r\n\r\nThere are two components of the pricing related to Azure Bastion:\r\n\r\n 1. **Fixed charge** for the service. This is the charge billed hourly for deploying the service. E.g. in an East US location, this charge is around $0.19 per hour.\r\n 2. **Outbound data transfer charges**. This is the charge based on the total outbound data transfer. This is further tiered into various categories based on the total consumption.\r\n\r\nThe pricing details can be found here: <a href=\"https:\/\/azure.microsoft.com\/en-ca\/pricing\/details\/azure-bastion\/\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Bastion pricing<\/a>\r\n\r\nYou can read more information about Azure Bastion in the official documentation here: <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/bastion\/bastion-overview\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Bastion Overview<\/a>.

		"body": "Let us assume that you have to define routing for a particular Azure service e.g. Azure Storage. Any communication to the Azure storage service should happen via your defined route e.g. a virtual appliance. To be able to define this route table you will need to define many routes for all the IP addresses corresponding to the Azure Storage service. Microsoft publishes all these IP addresses in a JSON format that you can leverage. This JSON file is available here: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/en-us\/download\/details.aspx?id=56519\" target=\"_blank\">Azure IP Ranges and Service Tags \u2013 Public Cloud<\/a>\r\n\r\nThis current process will involve around 504 routes corresponding to each IP address space published by Microsoft for Azure Storage service alone. To make matters even more complex, you have a limit on the total number of routes allowed in a subscription. You can have a max of 200 Route Tables and only 400 routes allowed per Route Tables. You can check all the service limits here: <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/azure-resource-manager\/management\/azure-subscription-service-limits\" target=\"_blank\">Azure subscription and service limits, quotas, and constraints<\/a>\r\n\r\n### Solution ###\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has published the solution for this problem. You can now leverage the Service Tags when defining User Defined Routes (or UDRs) in a Route Table. I believe this addresses a long-requested feature and makes the task to route any Microsoft service-related communication easy. \r\n\r\nThis service is currently in **Public Preview** (at the time of writing this blog post). Also, this service is only available via APIs i.e. via REST, PowerShell, CLI, and can also be used in ARM templates. This feature is **not** currently available through the Azure Portal.\r\n\r\nYou can now specify a Service Tag for the address prefix parameter in a user-defined route for your route table. You can choose from tags representing over 60 Microsoft and Azure services to simplify route creation and maintenance. \r\n\r\n - You no longer need to manually update routes when services change or add to their list of endpoints. Routes with Service Tags will update automatically to include new changes. \r\n - This also eliminates the need for regularly updating routes based on the IP data in the weekly JSON file downloads that Microsoft provides. \r\n - This also helps reduce the likelihood of running into the routes per route table limit (400) which is common when configuring routing for multiple Microsoft and Azure services. By using Service Tags, you can avoid this, since the tag condenses all ranges for that service into one group. \r\n - For example, Microsoft lists more than 4,500 prefixes that collectively represent the Azure address space. You can now use one route with the AzureCloud Service Tag which will include all of these. \r\n\r\nLearn more about this capability here: <a href=\"https:\/\/azure.microsoft.com\/en-us\/updates\/public-preview-service-tags-for-user-defined-routing\/\" target=\"_blank\">Public preview: Service Tags for User Defined Routing<\/a>",

These are dynamic links that the SUSE team keeps updating and should be referred if any communication is broken.\r\n\r\nThe **URLs** for the IP addresses are:\r\n\r\n - <a href=\"https:\/\/susepubliccloudinfo.suse.com\/v1\/microsoft\/servers\/smt.xml\" target=\"_blank\">https:\/\/susepubliccloudinfo.suse.com\/v1\/microsoft\/servers\/smt.xml<\/a>\r\n - <a href=\"https:\/\/susepubliccloudinfo.suse.com\/v1\/microsoft\/servers\/regionserver.xml\" target=\"_blank\">https:\/\/susepubliccloudinfo.suse.com\/v1\/microsoft\/servers\/regionserver.xml<\/a>\r\n\r\nIt is recommended to open the IP addresses for the regions where our VMs are deployed. The required communication occurs on **Port 443** i.e. HTTPS.\r\n\r\n### Long term solution ###\r\n\r\nLong term solution is to deploy a SUSE **RMT** (or **Repository Mirroring Tool**) server in the environment. For older versions of SLES, you may require SMT instead. It is highly recommended to upgrade and use RMT instead. \r\n\r\n\"*RMT server establishes a proxy system for SUSE Customer Center with repositories and registration targets.

The below steps are involved in configuring the Route Server:\r\n\r\n 1. Set up the peering by adding a Peer. This could be a Network Virtual Appliance or NVA. \r\n 2. Establish BGP session from the NVA\r\n 3. Optionally you can configure route exchange if you are trying to connect to ExpressRoute gateway or a VPN gateway. \r\n\r\nLet's look at these steps in detail. \r\n\r\n### Set up the peering ###\r\n\r\nNavigate to the Route server by click on this link: <a href=\"https:\/\/aka.ms\/routeserver\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Route Server<\/a>.\r\n\r\nClick on the \"**Peers**\" and then on the right side click on the \"**+ Add**\" button to add the peering. A pop-up window will open on the side to \"**Add Peer**\". In here enter the values for the NVA. Specifically, enter a name you want to give to this peering. And enter the ASN or *Autonomous Systems Number* for your NVA. Also, enter the  IP address of the NVA the Route Server will communicate with to establish BGP.\r\n\r\n**Note**: The virtual network where you deployed the Route Server should have connectivity to the IPv4 IP address of the NVA.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/1617039597606210ed9fa47.png\" alt=\"Adding a peer\">\r\n\r\n### Establish BGP session from the NVA ###\r\n\r\nThe connection with the NVA will not be established until you finish the configurations on the NVA. These configurations will vary depending on the type of NVA (e.g. Check Point, Palo Alto, to name a few). To complete the connection you will need to provide the NVA team with 2 pieces of information regarding the Route Server. These are:\r\n\r\n 1. Peer IPs for the Route Server\r\n 2. ASN number of the Route Server\r\n\r\nYou can get this information from the Overview page of the Route Server as shown below.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/1617039616606211003a605.png\" alt=\"Getting information for IP and ASN of Route Server\">\r\n\r\n### Configure route exchange - for ExpressRoute gateway or a VPN gateway ###\r\n\r\nIf you have an ExpressRoute gateway or VPN gateway or both and you want them to exchange routes with the Route Server, you can enable route exchange. It is simply a toggle setting in the Route server. You can access this from the Configurations section under the settings. Select \"Enabled\" for the \"Branch-to-branch\" setting and click on the Save button to save the settings.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/16170396306062110ea0a26.png\" alt=\"Configuring Route Exchange\">\r\n\r\nYou can find all the Route Server related official documentation here: <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/route-server\/\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Route Server documentation<\/a>",

You can view the previous post here: <a href=\"https:\/\/HarvestingClouds.com\/post\/understanding-the-azure-route-server\/\" target=\"_blank\">Understanding the Azure Route Server<\/a>\r\n\r\nIn this blog post, we will be setting up an **Azure Route Server** via the Azure Portal.\r\n\r\n### Pre-requisite ###\r\n\r\nIf you are setting up Azure Route Server for your Network Virtual Appliance or NVA, the two key pre-requisites are:\r\n\r\n 1. For you to be able to set up an Azure Route Server, you need to have an empty subnet in your virtual network with the name \"**RouteServerSubnet**\". This subnet should have an address space with a prefix of at least \"**\/27**\" or higher.\r\n 2. The NVA should allow the BGP protocol to leverage the benefits of having the Azure Route Server.\r\n\r\n### Finding the Route Server section ###\r\n\r\nTo find the section for Route Server navigate to this direct link: <a href=\"https:\/\/aka.ms\/routeserver\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Route Server<\/a>\r\n\r\nTo create a new Route Server, simply click on the \"**+ Create new route server**\" button.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/16170339076061fab3c3d27.png\" alt=\"Route Servers\">\r\n\r\n### Configurations ###\r\n\r\nIn the Basics section, provide the values for Subscription, Resource Group, Instance name of the route server, and Region for the deployment. Next you will need to select the Virtual network in the same region where you want to deploy the route server. The wizard will automatically select the subnet with the name \"RouteServerSubnet\". As noted earlier, this subnet should have at least a \"\/27\" prefix for the address space.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/16170345396061fd2b4b162.png\" alt=\"Basics\">\r\n\r\nNext, provide any Tags, and then click on \"Review + create\" and finally click on the \"Create\" button to create the route server.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/16170347226061fde24cce5.png\" alt=\"Create the Route Server\">\r\n\r\nBehind the scene it creates two resources of following types:\r\n\r\n - Microsoft.Network\/**virtualHubs**\r\n - Microsoft.Network\/virtualHubs\/**ipConfigurations**\r\n\r\nIf you check the Resource Group that you used for deployment, it will look empty. But when you click on the check box for \"Show hidden types\" you will be able to view the Virtual Hub that was deployed for the Route Server. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/161703712860620748445e8.png\" alt=\"Hidden type for Virtual Hub\">\r\n\r\nIn the next post, we will look at configuring the Route Server.

It eliminates the need to manually configure or maintain route tables. It is a fully managed service and is configured with high availability.\r\n\r\nThis service works with:\r\n\r\n 1. Network Virtual Appliance or NVA\r\n 2. ExpressRoute\r\n 3. Azure VPN Gateway\r\n\r\nYou can enable or disable the route exchange on the Azure Route Server with a simple command. Also, you don't need to manually configure or maintain route tables.\r\n\r\nWith NVAs, it allows you to exchange routing information directly through Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routing protocol between any NVA that supports the BGP routing protocol and the Azure Virtual Network.\r\n\r\n### Pre-requisite ###\r\n\r\n 1. For you to be able to set up an Azure Route Server, you need to have an empty subnet in your virtual network with the name \"**RouteServerSubnet**\". This subnet should have an address space with a prefix of at least \"**\/27**\" or higher.\r\n 2. The NVA should allow the BGP protocol to leverage the benefits of having the Azure Route Server.\r\n\r\n### Benefits ###\r\n\r\nAzure Route Server simplifies the configuration, management, and deployment of your NVA in your virtual network.\r\n\r\n 1. You no longer need to manually update the routing table on your NVA whenever your virtual network addresses are updated.\r\n 2. You no longer need to update User-Defined Routes manually whenever your NVA announces new routes or withdraw old ones.\r\n 3. You can peer multiple instances of your NVA with Azure Route Server.\r\n 4. The interface between NVA and Azure Route Server is based on a common standard protocol i.e. BGP.\r\n 5. You can deploy Azure Route Server in any of your new or existing virtual networks.\r\n\r\nIn the next blog post, we will create an Azure Route Server in the Azure portal.

Imagine if someone gets access to your Storage Account and deletes the contents of a Storage Account. Or if an employee accidentally deletes the contents of a container inside the Storage account. \r\n\r\nMicrosoft has added the support for soft delete. You can enable this while creating the storage account under the \"Data protection\". You have 4 key options that you can enable. These options are:\r\n\r\n 1. Turn on point-in-time restore for container\r\n 2. Turn on soft delete for blobs\r\n 3. Turn on soft delete for containers\r\n 4. Turn on soft delete for file shares\r\n\r\nThese options are shown below.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/161699099660615314d836a.png\" alt=\"Soft delete options in a Storage Account creation\">\r\n\r\n### Accessing the Soft Delete capabilities for a blob ###\r\n\r\nIf you have enabled the soft delete for blobs, then you will view a toggle to \"**Show deleted blobs**\". Any deleted blobs which was deleted within the configured number of days during the creation of the storage account will show up with the status as \"Deleted\". \r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/16169913746061548e330dd.png\" alt=\"Soft delete option after blob deletion\">\r\n\r\nYou can then either right-click or click on the three dots at the end of the line for the blob with Status as \"Deleted\". You will see the option for \"View previous versions\". Click on this option to see any deleted versions of this blob.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/16169915476061553bf39a3.png\" alt=\"View Previous Versions\">\r\n\r\nFrom the deleted versions of the blob, you can select any of the version and then you can either download that blob (by clicking on the **Download version** button) or restore it (by clicking on the **Make current version** button).\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can click on the deleted blob's name and a pane will open up. In this pane, you can click on the \"Undelete\" button. If you have multiple versions then to undelete you will have to select the version first.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/161699157160615553cb0ef.png\" alt=\"Restore or Download Previous version\">\r\n\r\nAfter restoring the blob, it will show up with the status as Active.\r\n\r\n**Note**: \r\n\r\n 1. The soft delete feature retains the data for only a fixed number of days. You define this number based on your recovery strategy during the creation of the storage account. \r\n 2. If you delete the Storage Account then you can't restore the blobs. \r\n\r\nYou can read more about this feature in the official documentation here: <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/storage\/blobs\/soft-delete-blob-overview\" target=\"_blank\">Soft delete for blobs<\/a>",

		"category": "Azure Backup",
		"body": "When you have SQL databases on Azure VMs that are syncing with Azure Backup, you may run into various issues. These could be due to configurations or missing dependencies. In this blog post, we will take a look at a few of the common issues that I had faced and possible solutions to these issues.\r\n\r\n### 1. First thing you should do for SAP HANA on Azure VM (Database).  ###\r\n\r\nBefore you go down the path of troubleshooting, make sure that you have re-run the pre-registration script. You will either resolve the issues or will get more understanding of why the issues are coming. You can download the script form this link: <a href=\"https:\/\/aka.ms\/scriptforpermsonhana\" target=\"_blank\">Pre-registration Script<\/a>\r\n\r\nNote that you may need to re-discover the databases after running the script again. If you look in the official troubleshooting guide you will notice that most of the issues are resolved by this one thing i.e. re-running the pre-registration script.\r\n\r\n### 2. Unhealthy status ###\r\n\r\n**Possible cause # 1**: \r\n\r\n - The unhealthy status could simply mean that you have just configured the backup on a database and there is no backup for the database present in the Azure recovery services vault. In this scenario, you can either wait for the backup schedule to trigger and take the initial backup. Or you can trigger a manual backup.\r\n\r\n**Possible cause # 2**:\r\n\r\n - Another reason could be that the Backup service is not able to take the backups of the SQL databases on the Azure VM. You should navigate to the Monitoring section in the recovery services vault and click on the Backup jobs. Filter the jobs by the name of the database or the Azure VM name. Look for any failed jobs and check the error details. These failed jobs will also contain the details about the reason why the job failed. \r\n\r\nIn one instance, my jobs were failing because the disk drive for Log was completely full. The resolution was to shut down the VM, expand the disk space via the Azure portal and then start the VM. Then expand the disk from the disk manager from within the VM. We manually triggered the full backup and it was successful. This in turn changed the status from Unhealthy to Healthy.\r\n\r\n### 3. Unreachable or Not reachable status ###\r\n\r\nThe most common cause for this issue is that the Azure Backup service is not able to reach the VM. Chances are that the backup-related communication is being blocked somewhere in the network. The backup agent indicates to the VM that it should send the backup to Azure. The communication happens mostly **Outbound from the VM** to the below services in Azure:\r\n\r\n 1. Azure Backup\r\n 2. Azure Storage\r\n 3. Azure Active Directory\r\n\r\nIf any of the services is not allowed then the status changes to Unreachable. \r\n\r\nYou may have two or both scenarios in your environment:\r\n\r\n 1. Your VM has an NSG linked to the VM's network interface card or an NSG linked to the subnet in which the VM exists.\r\n 2. Your VM is in an environment where all communication is gated via a Network Virtual Appliance (NVA) or Firewall.\r\n\r\nIf you have NSGs then skip to the last section to see how to configure the NSGs for the backup service to work. If you have Firewall then continue here on how to troubleshoot.\r\n\r\nYou should look for outbound communication from the VM to these services in the Firewall if you have any. You will need to validate against the public IP addresses for these public services. But how will you find the IP addresses for these. We will look at that next.\r\n\r\n### 4. How to find the IP addresses for Azure services ###\r\n\r\nMicrosoft publishes the public IP addresses for all of its services in a **JSON file**. This is categorized by Service tags. These service tags correspond to each of the Azure services. \r\n\r\nYou can download this JSON file by navigating to this link: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/en-us\/download\/details.aspx?id=56519\" target=\"_blank\">Azure IP Ranges and Service Tags \u2013 Public Cloud<\/a>\r\n\r\nAfter downloading this JSON, search for \"Storage\", \"Active Directory\" and \"Backup\" services to find the section which defines a list of public IP addresses for that service. Note that there will be multiple IP address ranges for each service. Look for the region-specific ranges where you have deployed the VM and the backup vault.\r\n\r\nIf you find an IP address from the list being blocked for any of the 3 services mentioned above, then you should follow the next section and work with your Firewall team to open these required rules. \r\n\r\n### 5. Configuration of the Firewall to allow Azure backup ###\r\n\r\nNote this only applies to the backup of SQL Server on Azure VM or SAP HANA on Azure VM (Database). Allow access to the following services in the Firewall for the network infrastructure where the Azure VM exists.\r\n\r\n<table class=\"table\"><caption class=\"visually-hidden\">Allow access to service FQDNs<\/caption>\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>Service<\/th>\r\n<th>Domain  names to be accessed<\/th>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<\/thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Azure  Backup<\/td>\r\n<td><code>*.backup.windowsazure.com<\/code><\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Azure  Storage<\/td>\r\n<td><code>*.blob.core.windows.net<\/code> <br><br> <code>*.queue.core.windows.net<\/code><\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Azure  AD<\/td>\r\n<td>Allow  access to FQDNs under sections 56 and 59 according to <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/microsoft-365\/enterprise\/urls-and-ip-address-ranges?view=o365-worldwide#microsoft-365-common-and-office-online\" target=\"_blank\">this article<\/a><\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<\/tbody>\r\n<\/table>\r\n\r\n### 6. NSG configurations to allow Azure backup ###\r\n\r\nNote this only applies to the backup of SQL Server on Azure VM or SAP HANA on Azure VM (Database). \r\n\r\nGo to the NSG i.e. Network Security Group of the Azure VM which is either linked via subnet or via the network interface of the VM. Navigate to the Outbound rules and add three rules to allow communication to the below destination Service Tags on all ports:\r\n\r\n 1. Storage\r\n 2. Azure Backup\r\n 3. Azure Active Directory\r\n\r\nThe rules will look like below:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/16170808506062b212f0139.png\" alt=\"NSG Rules\">\r\n\r\n### 7. Permissions issue or UserErrorSQLNoSysadminMembership ###\r\n\r\nIf you are getting the error for \"UserErrorSQLNoSysadminMembership\" then that means the permissions for SQL Server on Azure VM have not been set appropriately. This usually happens if you built the SQL server on the Azure VM yourself. That is you didn't use any marketplace image for SQL on Azure VM. \r\n\r\nYou need to set the permissions as defined here: <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/backup\/backup-azure-sql-database#set-vm-permissions\" target=\"_blank\">Set VM permissions<\/a>.\r\n\r\n### More Information ###\r\n\r\nIf you are still facing issues, do refer the below links for official documentation: \r\n\r\n - <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/backup\/tutorial-backup-sap-hana-db#prerequisites\" target=\"_blank\">Back up SAP HANA databases in an Azure VM<\/a>\r\n - <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/backup\/tutorial-sql-backup\" target=\"_blank\">Back up a SQL Server database in an Azure VM<\/a>\r\n - <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/backup\/backup-sql-server-azure-troubleshoot\" target=\"_blank\">Troubleshoot SQL Server database backup by using Azure Backup<\/a>\r\n - <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/backup\/backup-azure-sap-hana-database-troubleshoot\" target=\"_blank\">Troubleshoot backup of SAP HANA databases on Azure<\/a>\r\n",

Differential Backup - this controls the differential backup of the databases\r\n 4. Incremental Backup - this controls the incremental backup of the databases\r\n 5. Log Backup - this defines the log backup for the databases\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/16170729086062930cc12fb.png\" alt=\"Create Policy\">\r\n\r\nFor the **full backup** in the policy, if you enable it then at minimum you need to define:\r\n\r\n 1. Frequency - daily or weekly\r\n 2. Time and Time zone - when the backup will occur\r\n 3. Retention for the daily backup. It can be a minimum of 7 days and up to a maximum of 9999 days.\r\n\r\nOptionally you can also configure the monthly, weekly, and yearly backup retention policies.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/16170729976062936570128.png\" alt=\"Full Backup Policy\">\r\n\r\nThe **log backup policy** determines the behavior of the log backups. At minimum you need to define:\r\n\r\n 1. The frequency of the log backups - it can range from a minimum of 15 minutes to a maximum of once every 24 hours\r\n 2. Retention of the log backups - it can range from a minimum of 7 days to a maximum of 14 days\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/16170730066062936e31b78.png\" alt=\"Log Backup Policy\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### Practical Backup Considerations ###\r\n\r\nBelow are some general backup considerations based on my experience in different projects. These are only generic considerations and should be evaluated against your organization's compliance standards and specific requirements.\r\n\r\n - The time for backup should be when the systems are not being used by any of the teams. If you work in global teams i.e. working around the clock, then ensure the timing when the system is under the least load.\r\n - Use smaller retention windows in the non-production environments than the production environments\r\n - If the data is not critical then usually Full backup is taken Daily and retained for around 14 days in non-prod environments. Weekly, Monthly, and Yearly retention periods are not required. \r\n - In the prod environment, the Full backup is still taken Daily but the retention period is increased to more than 30 days. Max you can select is 9999 days. Also, based on your SLAs and compliance standards you should enable the weekly, monthly, and yearly backup retention periods as well.\r\n - Differential backup can be skipped in the non-production environments based on the criticality of the data in the lower environments\r\n - Log backup can be reduced to once every 2 or 4 hours with a retention period of around 7 days in the non-prod environments. \r\n - In the prod environments the Log backup can be set to 1 hour or less. The retention should be around 14 days based on the SLAs. Note that 14 days is the max you can go.",

Policy name - provide a descriptive name\r\n 2. Full Backup - this is the schedule and retention of the full backup of the databases on the SQL Server in Azure VM.\r\n 3. Differential Backup - this controls the differential backup of the databases on the SQL Server in Azure VM\r\n 4. Log Backup - this defines the log backup for the databases\r\n 5. SQL Backup Compression - you can enable or disable the backup compression. The default value is disabled.\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/161707060360628a0b9f421.png\" alt=\"Create Policy\">\r\n\r\nFor the **full backup** in the policy, if you enable it then at minimum you need to define:\r\n\r\n 1. Frequency - daily or weekly\r\n 2. Time and Time zone - when the backup will occur\r\n 3. Retention for the daily backup\r\n\r\nOptionally you can also configure the monthly, weekly, and yearly backup retention policies.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/161707140060628d2891621.png\" alt=\"Full Backup Policy\">\r\n\r\nThe **log backup policy** determines the behavior of the log backups. At minimum you need to define:\r\n\r\n 1. The frequency of the log backups - it can range from a minimum of 15 minutes to a maximum of once every 24 hours\r\n 2. Retention of the log backups - it can range from minimum of 7 days to a maximum of 35 days\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/161707140860628d30af713.png\" alt=\"Log Backup Policy\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### Practical Backup Considerations ###\r\n\r\nBelow are some general backup considerations based on my experience in different projects. These are only generic considerations and should be evaluated against your organization's compliance standards and specific requirements.\r\n\r\n - The time for backup should be when the systems are not being used by any of the teams. If you work in global teams i.e. working around the clock, then ensure the timing when the system is under the least load.\r\n - Use smaller retention windows in the non-production environments than the production environments\r\n - If the data is not critical then usually Full backup is taken Daily and retained for around 14 days in non-prod environments. Weekly, Monthly, and Yearly retention periods are not required. \r\n - In the prod environment, the Full backup is still taken Daily but the retention period is increased to more than 30 days. Max you can select is 9999 days. Also, based on your SLAs and compliance standards you should enable the weekly, monthly, and yearly backup retention periods as well.\r\n - Differential backup can be skipped in the non-production environments based on the criticality of the data in the lower environments\r\n - Log backup can be reduced to once every 2 or 4 hours with a retention period of 7-14 days in the non-prod environments. \r\n - In the prod environments the Log backup can be set to 1 hour or less. The retention should be 14-35 days based on the SLAs. Note that 35 is the max you can go.",

You can  view that post here: <a href=\"https:\/\/HarvestingClouds.com\/post\/azure-backup-set-storage-redundancy-for-recovery-services-vault\/\" target=\"_blank\">Set Storage Redundancy for Recovery Services Vault<\/a>\r\n\r\nIn this post, we will look at how to take control of the replicated data.\r\n\r\nBy default, the data that is replicated to the secondary region is available to restore in the secondary region only if Azure declares a disaster in the primary region. But now you can also control the cross-region restore (CRR) yourself. You can trigger a cross-region restore regardless of whether the primary region is available or not. Azure Backup now supports restoring Azure Virtual Machines as well as disks from a secondary region.\r\n\r\nBehind the scene, Azure Backup leverages storage accounts\u2019 read-access geo-redundant storage (**RA-GRS**) capability to support restores from a secondary region. If you enable cross-region-restore, Microsoft upgrades your backup storage from GRS to read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS). Charges for storage are separate from the cost of Azure Backup.\r\n\r\n**Note** that due to delays in storage replication from primary to secondary, there will be **latency** in the backed-up data being available for a restore in the secondary region.\r\n\r\nCross-Region Restore (CRR) supports the following data sources:\r\n\r\n - Azure VMs\r\n - SQL databases on Azure VMs \r\n - SAP HANA databases on Azure VMs\r\n\r\n### Configurations ###\r\n\r\nTo update the Cross-Region Restore (CRR) settings: \r\n\r\n 1. Navigate to the recovery services vault and click on the **Properties** under Settings\r\n 2. Then click on the \"**Update**\" link under the Backup Configuration\r\n 3. In the Backup Configurations blade, make sure that the setting for redundancy is set to \"Geo-Redundant\". Then select \"**Enable**\" for the \"**Cross Region Restore**\" setting.\r\n\r\nFinally, click on the Save button to save the settings.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/16170496926062385cf189b.png\" alt=\"Cross-Region Restore\">\r\n\r\n**Note**: Cross Region Restore is currently non-reversible storage property. This means that you won't be able to disable the property after enabling it. \r\n\r\nOnce you have the option enabled, when you will navigate to the Protected Items -> Backup Items -> Azure Virtual Machine -> select a VM that is protected and has a valid backup. You will view a new option to \"Restore to Secondary Region\". \r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/16170528126062448cb338f.png\" alt=\"Option to restore the VM to Secondary Region\">\r\n\r\nTo be able to use this option, you don't just need there to be a valid backup but also need that backup to be replicated to the secondary region. If your primary region is \"East US\" then you need to have at least one copy in the \"West US\" region. Also, note that you will only be able to restore to a secondary region that is a paired region of the region where you have deployed the resources.\r\n\r\nYou can find which is the secondary paired region based on the region where you have deployed the resources by referring the table in this link: <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/best-practices-availability-paired-regions#azure-regional-pairs\" target=\"_blank\">Business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR): Azure Paired Regions<\/a> ",

Then you can do so for each and every IP address published by Microsoft for Azure Storage service. This is a very cumbersome method and is not practical. Also, there is a limit to the number of rules you can write and the number of NSGs you can have in a subscription. You can have up to 1000 rules per NSG. Also, you can have only a maximum of 200 NSGs in a subscription. You can find these limits here: <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/azure-resource-manager\/management\/azure-subscription-service-limits\" target=\"_blank\">Azure subscription and service limits, quotas, and constraints.<\/a>\r\n\r\n## Solution ##\r\n\r\nMicrosoft provides the capability to write NSG rules using Service Tag as a destination. When you leverage a Service tag the system ensures that it accounts for all the IP addresses for that service. Not only that, if any IP address changes or a new IP address is added then the Service Tag will account for that automatically. You can target whole services across different regions or services in a particular region. E.g. You can select Storage as a service or select \"Storage.EastUS\" to target the Storage service but only in the East US region.\r\n\r\n## Where is the Option ##\r\n\r\nIn the **Inbound security rules**, this option is available for the Source. In the **Outbound security rules**, this option is available for the Destination. Once you select the service tag as the option, then you are presented with a drop-down for the Service Tag selection. Internet is the default option for the Service Tag. You can type and search for the particular service tag e.g. Azure Storage, Azure Backup, etc.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/16169643636060eb0bc8678.png\" alt=\"Service Tag option\">\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can read more about Service Tags here: <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/virtual-network\/service-tags-overview\" target=\"_blank\">Virtual network service tags<\/a>.",

It enables Azure resources, like Virtual Machines (VMs), to communicate privately with linked resources. Under the hood, it creates a network interface card (NIC) on the Azure SQL Server and attaches that to your Virtual network. That way you get a private IP address assigned to your Azure SQL Server. Now from any other resource on this network, you can securely access the Azure SQL Server without the communication leaving the network at all. \r\n\r\nMicrosoft also goes one step further by creating a **Private DNS integration**. It leverages a private DNS zone to provide a DNS name for your Azure SQL Database Server which is mapped to the Private IP address (instead of the usual Public). \r\n\r\nIn this post, you will be setting up the private endpoints to the SQL server through Azure Portal.

		"body": "**Network Watcher** is like a swiss knife for various things related to networking. This is a one-stop-shop for monitoring and troubleshooting your networks and related components. In this post, we will be focusing on the troubleshooting related aspects of Network Watcher.\r\n\r\n### Enabling Network Watcher ###\r\n\r\nFirst of all, you need to enable network watcher. You should do so for every region where you have a virtual network deployed or will deploy in the near future. To do so simply navigate to the Network Watcher service (by searching for it). In the Overview screen, expand the regions area as shown below. Right-click on the region for which you want to enable this service and select \"*Enable network watcher*\". \r\n\r\nThe first time you do this, it will create a new resource group called \"NetworkWatcherRG\". If you check this resource group after enabling network watcher for any region, it will look empty, but it actually contains hidden resources of type \"*microsoft.network\/networkwatchers*\".\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15851936465e7c22ae8edbe.png\" alt=\"Enabling Network Watcher\">\r\n\r\nOnce the network watcher is enabled, you are ready for consuming various mini tools (or different sections) that give you troubleshooting features.\r\n\r\n### IP Flow Verify ###\r\n\r\nThis is to check the IP Flow. If you want to check if the traffic is able to flow or is being blocked then this is the section you want to check. Select the VM and its network interface for which you want to check the IP Flow. The Local IP address will be auto-populated. Fill in the details for the Remote IP address and Remote port and click on the Check button. It will simulate the traffic and will let you know the results. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15851936555e7c22b7e441a.png\" alt=\"IP Flow Verify\">\r\n\r\n### Next Hop ###\r\n\r\nIf you have various Route tables and you want to verify that the traffic follows a particular route or not then \"Next Hop\" is the section you want to check. You can check if traffic from a source to destination will go via network virtual appliance or not based on a route defined in a route table or not. \r\n\r\nSimply select the source and destination. The Source IP address will populate based on the network interface selected. And the destination IP address will be input by you. Click on the \"Next hop\" button once you are ready. The output will show you what the next hop will be and the route along with the route table that is directing that traffic to that next hop.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15851936625e7c22be7dc81.png\" alt=\"Next Hop\">\r\n\r\n### Effective Security Rules ###\r\n\r\nYou may have various Network Security Groups (NSGs) applied to a VM i.e. one NSG applied directly on its network interface and another one applied at the subnet level. If you want to check what is the result set of these NSGs and which NSGs are effectively applied on your VM, then this is the section that you can use. Simply select your Virtual Machine (VM) and the effective security rules will be displayed in the bottom section. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15851936705e7c22c6906dc.png\" alt=\"Effective Security Rules\">\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information please check this link: <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/network-watcher\/network-watcher-monitoring-overview\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Network Watcher<\/a>\r\n",

Overview: The first page when you land on this window is the overview page. \r\n 2. Activity log: Platform logs provide detailed diagnostic and auditing information for Azure resources and the Azure platform they depend on. They are automatically generated although you need to configure certain platform logs to be forwarded to one or more destinations to be retained.\r\n 3. Access Control (IAM): Review the level of access a user, group, service principal, or managed identity has to this resource.\r\n 4. Tags: This is used to provide some keywords to your resource.\r\n 5. Diagnostic and solve problems: This provides you the list of troubleshooting links for the known issues a user can come across.\r\n\r\n###Section 2 Getting Started###\r\n\r\nQuick Start: This provide the basic tutorial\/videos link on how to work with the Data factory. They have been provided by Microsoft and you can see the documentation about the subject. It is really helpful as it gives a quick understanding of the topic.\r\n\r\n###Section 3 Monitoring###\r\n\r\n 1.\tAlerts: Configure alert rules and attend to fired alerts to efficiently monitor your Azure resources.\r\n 2.\tMetrics: Configure alert rules and attend to fired alerts to efficiently monitor yourAzure resources. For more details, please refer to the Microsoft official documentation for Metrics \r\nat https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/azure-monitor\/platform\/metrics-getting-started\r\n 3.\tDiagnostic settings: They are used to collect platform logs and metrics in Azure. To get more information on how to create the diagnostic settings using Azure Portal\/CLI\/Powershell, please refer to the official Microsoft documentation at https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/azure-monitor\/platform\/diagnostic-settings\r\n\r\n###Section 4 Author & Monitor###\r\n\r\nAuthor and Monitor link is the most important link which takes you to the authoring console. This console opens up the new window. This is where you can create Azure-SSIS IR, pipelines, linked services, data sets, and data flow, etc.\r\nI will be explaining this more in the upcoming posts.\r\n\r\n###Section 5 Monitoring ###\r\n\r\nThis section is the summarization of the activities happening in the Azure Data Factory. Pipelines status whether it was successful or failed. TriggerRun information that when the pipelines ran. You can also check the CPU and Memory utilization of the IR. You can view or set up all these monitoring status on the Metrics mentioned in section 3.\r\n\r\n",

To make your SQL database perform better we need some insights to get better recommendations and it is provided by default by Azure.\r\n\r\n### Performance Recommendations ###\r\n\r\nPerformance overview provides a summary of your database performance and helps you with performance tuning and troubleshooting.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15845063695e71a601ea489.png\" alt=\"Performance recommendation\">\r\n\r\n(Per Microsoft documentation) the performance recommendation options available for single and pooled databases in Azure SQL Database are:\r\n\r\n -\tCreate index recommendations - Recommends the creation of indexes that may improve the performance of your workload.\t\r\n -\tDrop index recommendations - Recommends removal of redundant and duplicate indexes daily, except for unique indexes, and indexes that were not used for a long time (>90 days). Please note that this option is not compatible with applications using partition switching and index hints. Dropping unused indexes is not supported for Premium and Business Critical service tiers.\t\r\n -\tParameterize queries recommendations (preview) - Recommends forced parameterization in cases when you have one or more queries that are constantly being recompiled but end up with the same query execution plan.\t\r\n -\tFix schema issues recommendations (preview) - Recommendations for schema correction appear when the SQL Database service notices an anomaly in the number of scheme-related SQL errors that are happening on your SQL database. Microsoft is currently deprecating the \"Fix schema issue\" recommendations.\r\n\r\n### Automatic Tuning ###\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15845063775e71a60998da5.png\" alt=\"Automatic Tuning\">\r\n\r\nAzure SQL Database automatic tuning provides peak performance and stable workloads through continuous performance tuning based on AI and machine learning.\r\nAutomatic tuning is a fully managed intelligent performance service that uses built-in intelligence to continuously monitor queries executed on a database, and it automatically improves their performance. This is achieved by dynamically adapting the database to the changing workloads and applying tuning recommendations. Automatic tuning learns horizontally from all databases on Azure through AI and it dynamically improves its tuning actions. The longer a database runs with automatic tuning on, the better it performs.\r\nAzure SQL Database automatic tuning might be one of the most important features that you can enable to provide stable and peak performing database workloads.\r\n\r\nWhat can automatic tuning do for you:\r\n\r\n -\tAutomated performance tuning of Azure SQL databases\r\n -\tAutomated verification of performance gains\r\n -\tAutomated rollback and self-correction\r\n -\tTuning history\r\n -\tTuning action T-SQL scripts for manual deployments\r\n -\tProactive workload performance monitoring\r\n -\tScale-out capability on hundreds of thousands of databases\r\n -\tThe positive impact to DevOps resources and the total cost of ownership\r\n\r\n",

Launch SSMS and the \"Connect to Server\" popup should open up automatically. Azure doesn\u2019t support Windows Authentication. So you will need to log in using SQL server authentication with the username and password created in the Azure portal for the server or via AAD options. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15844873805e715bd4012ad.png\" alt=\"SSMS - Connect to SQL Server\">\r\n\r\nBefore login, you will need the connectivity details and to get that follow the below steps.\r\n\r\n 1. Get the server details to which you will connect. Make sure you get the server name instead of the database name. Sometimes people get confused. The server will have the naming convention as servername.Database.windows.net \r\n 2. Set up the server firewall in the Azure portal. Otherwise, you will not be able to connect with the server. It will throw an error.\r\n\r\nTo set up the Server Firewall: Go to all resources and select SQL Databases, it will show up all the databases you have created in your subscription.\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15844873975e715be5da8bd.png\" alt=\"Finding Azure SQL Databases\">\r\n\r\nSelect the database to which you want the connectivity. Let\u2019s take an example of the selected database below. Once you click on your database (test01 in the example below), it will open up the blade for that specific database. Go to the \"**Set server Firewall**\" option as selected.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15844874265e715c02ef51e.png\" alt=\"Option to Set Firewall\">\r\n\r\nHere you can add the IP ranges and\/or specific IP addresses from where you want the access allowed to this Database. In the below example, we are adding the **Client IP** (i.e. the IP address of the client from where you are accessing the Azure portal. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15844874355e715c0b484f0.png\" alt=\"Adding the Client IP for connectivity in the Firewall\">\r\n\r\nBy default, there will be no IP added under the Client IP address section. Once you click on step 1, then it will populate the IP address of your machine. In the large organization, you can set up the start and end IP.\r\n\r\nNote that there is a radio button to allow Azure services and resources to access this server, this will ensure the azure services can monitor your database performance to do analytics for the diagnostic operations. \r\nOnce you click Save, you should be able to connect the Azure SQL databases using SSMS.\r\n\r\n",

In this post we will see how to create the databases. To create the Azure SQL database, you need to know the subscription under you want to create the Azure SQL database.\r\n\r\nBelow is the first screen to start with the creation of the SQL database. Here you do the following:\r\n\r\n 1. Select the **Subscription** under which you want to create the SQL database.\r\n 2. You can select the **Resource group** from the dropdown of already created resource groups or you can create a new one as highlighted below. The next section defines the properties of the new SQL database.\r\n 3. Give the appropriate **name** of the SQL database\r\n 4. Select the already existing **server** under which you want to create the SQL database or you can create the new server.\r\n 5. Select \u2018No\u2019 under the SQL Elastic pool option. Select \u2018Yes\u2019 if you want your resources to be shared between multiple databases.\r\n 6. The next one is **compute and storage**, Azure automatically selected the basic one for me. In case you want more powerful resources, you can change this configuration by clicking on the Configure database link.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15844868925e7159ec6ce2e.png\" alt=\"Basic settings\">\r\n\r\nThe next screen is for Networking. Leave be the default setting as shown in the below screenshot.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15844869015e7159f531b66.png\" alt=\"Networking settings\">\r\n\r\nNext Screen is **Additional settings**. This screen is used to set the Collation of the SQL database, data source, and advanced data security.\r\nData source by default is None.  If you want to import the backup file of some existing database then select the Backup. If you select the \u2018Sample\u2019 option then AdventureWorksLT will be created as the sample database.\r\n\r\nDatabase Collation keeps the default one until unless you have another collation to select based upon different regions.\r\n\r\n**Advanced Data Security**: Azure charges extra if you select this option. For the time being, I am selecting as \u2018Not now\u2019. We will revisit this setting in detail in a later blog post.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15844869095e7159fd104cc.png\" alt=\"Additional settings\">\r\n\r\nThe next screen is about Tags. Tags are used to categorize your resources. These can later be used in billing and automation etc.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15844869165e715a042d59e.png\" alt=\"Tags\">\r\n\r\nThe final screen is \u2018Review + Create\u2019. You can review all the options selected in previous screens and it will provide you the estimated cost per month based upon your selection. If you are ok with it then click on the Create button at the bottom of the screen.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15844869475e715a234c628.png\" alt=\"Review and Create\">\r\n\r\nYou can see the progress at the top right-hand side.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15844869545e715a2a01864.png\" alt=\"Checking Deployment Status\">\r\n\r\nOnce the deployment is done, You can see the newly created databases under All services -> SQL databases.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15844869605e715a30a059d.png\" alt=\"Locating deployed Database\">\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Now in this post, we will work with these NSGs and create some rules. We will also check how to assign these to a subnet (or network interface) in Azure. \r\n\r\nThere are two types of rules that you define in an NSG:\r\n\r\n 1. **Inbound Rules** - these rules dictate what incoming traffic will be allowed. \r\n 2. **Outbound Rules** - these rules determine what outgoing traffic will be allowed.\r\n\r\nYou define the source and destination for each rule along with the protocol and port information. For **inbound** traffic, the destination will be the associated subnet or network interface. Similarly, for the **outbound** traffic, the source will be the associate subnet or network interface. \r\n\r\nThe rules in an NSG has a priority number. Smaller the priority, the higher in the order it is and it will be executed first. When inbound or outbound traffic hits the NSG then the rules are evaluated in the order based on their priority. If a matching rule is found, then the subsequent rules are NOT evaluated. The traffic is either allowed or denied, as per what is defined in the matching rule.\r\n\r\nNavigate to your Network Security Groups (NSGs) and check the overview screen. You will notice that there are default rules for both Inbound and Outbound rules. These allow connectivity between subnets within the same virtual network. You can update these as well, but the best practice is to overwrite these by writing another rule with higher priority. **Note** that a lower number means a higher priority.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15850320575e79ab79810f1.png\" alt=\"NSG and Rules\">\r\n\r\n### Adding Inbound and Outbound Rules ###\r\nYou can add\/update the Inbound and Outbound Rules from the settings. Since these two are very similar, we will only be looking at the Inbound security rules. These are more important as these dictate who can talk to the VM from the outside world( i.e. out of your virtual network).\r\n\r\nClick on the \"Inbound security rules\" option under the Settings menu. Check all the default rules. To create a new rule, click on the \"*+Add*\" button.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15850320685e79ab844d47a.png\" alt=\"Adding Inbound Security Rules\">\r\n\r\nOne Inbound rule consists of:\r\n\r\n 1. **Source** (IP address in CIDR format) and it's port ranges\r\n 2. **Destination** (IP address in CIDR format) and it's port ranges\r\n 3. **Protocol** for the communication\r\n 4. **Action** - this is either *allow* or *deny* and based upon this select the traffic will be either allowed or dropped\r\n 5. **Priority** - a number depicting the priority of a rule in NSG. Lower this number, higher the priority of a rule\r\n 6. Provide a **name** and **description** for the rule as well. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15850320775e79ab8dd06c9.png\" alt=\"Inbound rule\">\r\n\r\nFor defining Source or Destination you have various template options that you can choose from. These include:\r\n\r\n 1. Any\r\n 2. IP Addresses\r\n 3. Virtual Network\r\n 4. Application security group\r\n\r\nThat's it! Hit create and the NSG rule is ready.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15850332125e79affc65963.png\" alt=\"Destination\">\r\n\r\n### Assigning the NSGs ###\r\n\r\nThese NSGs can be assigned at two levels: \r\n\r\n 1. **Subnet level** - At this level, all the inbound and outbound rules in the NSG are applied to all the Network Interfaces (i.e. VMs) inside the subnet.\r\n 2. **Network Interface level** - At this level, the rules only apply to that particular network interface and other interfaces are not affected.\r\n\r\nSimply navigate to either one of those as per your requirements. In the below screenshot, we are at the subnet level. Click on the \"***+Associate***\" button. In the popup select the virtual network and the subnet in it, with which you want to link this NSG. Hit Save to save these configurations. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15850332185e79b002c509d.png\" alt=\"Associating Subnets and Network interfaces\">\r\n\r\n\r\nThat's it! You are all set. Now you can control the traffic via NSGs and allow only the traffic that adheres to the standard at your organizations with utmost importance to security aspects.\r\n",

From official documentation: \"The endpoints also extend the identity of your VNet to the Azure services over a direct connection. Endpoints allow you to secure your critical Azure service resources to only your virtual networks. Traffic from your VNet to the Azure service always remains on the Microsoft Azure backbone network.\". \r\n\r\nWhen you enable Service Endpoints, the IP address for a Microsoft service, switches from a public IP address to a private IP address. If you have any firewall rules in place then those will need to be updated. E.g. a VM connecting to a Microsoft Azure SQL database. \r\n\r\n**Note** that a service endpoint is always enabled on a **Subnet** level. \r\n\r\nTo begin, navigate to the Virtual Networks and select the virtual network you require. Under settings menu, click on the \"Service endpoints\". To create a new service endpoint click on the \"+Add\" button.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15850264655e7995a16747c.png\" alt=\"Service Endpoints\">\r\n\r\nYou are prompted to enter a service. You can pick from one of the service available. *Microsoft.Storage* and *Microsoft.Sql* are the most common use cases from the list. Microsoft keeps updating this list over a period of time.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15850264715e7995a732e35.png\" alt=\"Selecting the Service\">\r\n\r\nOnce the service is selected, next select the subnet for which you want to enable the service endpoint. Hit Ok and you are done. It will take some time for the configurations to finish at the backend, but now you will have connectivity from your network to the service leveraging private IP addresses internally (instead of public IP addresses).\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15850276965e799a70e94fe.png\" alt=\"Linking the Service to the Subnet\">\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information check this link: <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/virtual-network\/virtual-network-service-endpoints-overview\" target=\"_blank\">Virtual Network service endpoints<\/a>\r\n",

Both are acting as a firewall and restricting the traffic. There are few key differences between the two that we need to understand so that we can create and apply this appropriately to any situation at hand. \r\n\r\n### Scope ###\r\n\r\n**Network ACLs** are applied at the **Subnet** level. These restrict the traffic, coming in or out of the subnet. ACLs are therefore automatically applied to all resources (e.g. EC2 instances) in the subnet. \r\n\r\nWhereas the **Security Groups** are applied at the **EC2 instances** level. \r\n\r\nNetwork ACLs act as a secondary layer of defense. Also, if anyone forgets to apply Security Groups at the EC2 instances then Network ACLs assist in setting up standards in terms of allowed and blocked traffic in your environment. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15849551955e787f3b35cf1.png\" alt=\"Traffic Diagram with Network ACLs and Security Groups\">\r\n\r\n(Image source: https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/vpc\/latest\/userguide\/VPC_Security.html)\r\n\r\n### Rule Types ###\r\n\r\nIn a Security Group, all the traffic is automatically denied. You can only define \"Allow\" rules. And the traffic is allowed as per these rules. \r\n\r\nWhereas in Network ACLs you decide and configure for each rule if the traffic is Allowed or Denied\r\n\r\n### Rules Evaluation ###\r\n\r\nIn a Security Group, all rules are evaluated, regardless of their order, to determine what traffic is allowed. As all traffic is denied by default and you can only specify allow rules (with no priority or rule number), all the rules need to be evaluated to determine if the traffic is allowed or not. \r\n\r\nIn contrast, in Network ACLs, the rules are evaluated in order. If a matching rule is found for the traffic, then subsequent rules are NOT evaluated and the traffic is either Allowed or Denied as mentioned in the first matching rule.\r\n\r\n### Statefulness ###\r\n\r\nA Security Group is **Stateful**. Return traffic is automatically allowed, regardless of any rules. In contrast, the Network ACLs are **Stateless**. Return traffic must be explicitly allowed by the rules.\r\n\r\nFor more information please check the official information here: <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/vpc\/latest\/userguide\/VPC_Security.html\" target=\"_blank\">Internetwork Traffic Privacy in Amazon VPC<\/a>",

It is like a firewall that restricts the traffic at the EC2 instance level. These are applied to the EC2 instances. Once the traffic is filtered by the Network ACLs at the subnet level, it is then filtered further by the security group.\r\n\r\n**NOTE**: All the traffic is automatically denied in a Security Group. Only the traffic defined in a security group is allowed to EC2 instances.\r\n\r\nTo access the security groups, navigate to the VPC section in AWS and then click on the \"**Security Groups**\" option in the Security menu on the left. You can view all your security groups here. Select one and view its properties in the bottom panel. These properties include Description, Inbound rules, Outbound rules, and Tags. You can either right-click on the security group or click on the Actions button to view the action that you can take on this security group. The key actions we are interested in includes:\r\n\r\n - Edit Inbound rules\r\n - Edit Outbound rules\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15849519495e78728d61791.png\" alt=\"Security Groups\">\r\n\r\n\"**Edit Inbound rules**\" option is to edit the inbound rules. These govern what traffic will be allowed coming into the EC2 instances. Each rule contains:\r\n\r\n 1. **Type** - this determines the protocol or type of traffic. You have loads of pre-defined types, or you can add a custom option from the list\r\n 2. **Protocol** - this is determined by the type\r\n 3. **Port Range** - this is also dependent on the type selected. For pre-defined types, this is auto-populated. For custom type, you can define a custom port range.\r\n 4. **Source** - this is the place from where the communication will originate (that is coming into the associated subnet). You can have source as Anywhere or can define a custom IP address range via a CIDR\r\n 5. **Description** - description of the rule.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15849519555e787293d9950.png\" alt=\"Edit Inbound rules\">\r\n\r\n\"**Edit Outbound rules**\" option is to edit the outbound rules. These govern what traffic will be allowed coming out of the EC2 instance. These rules are very similar to the inbound rules.

There are inbound and outbound rules defined in these ACLs that determine what traffic is allowed in a subnet and what traffic will be blocked. These are great for the security of your network. \r\n\r\nTo access the Network ACLs, navigate to the VPC section in AWS and then click on the \"Network ACLs\" option in the Security menu on the left. \r\n\r\nYou can view all your ACLs here.

You can view all posts in this series here:<b> <a href=\"https:\/\/HarvestingClouds.com\/post\/azure-for-aws-professionals-index\" target=\"_blank\">Azure for AWS professionals - Index<\/a><\/b>\r\n\r\nA **Route Table** is just as the name suggests, it is a table consisting of the routes. This determines how the traffic is routed between the subnets and even out of the virtual network. Each entry in this table is called a \"**route**\". When you create a VPC, one main route table is automatically created for your VPC and is associated with the subnet of the VPC. You can create custom route tables. E.g. you may want to send all traffic to a network virtual appliance i.e. a firewall. You may have Palo Alto or CheckPoint or any other firewall in your environment and you want the traffic to route via that firewall. You can achieve this via route tables.\r\n\r\nTo start, navigate to your VPC section in AWS. Then from the left menu, click on the \"**Route Tables**\" option. You can create a new table here as well by clicking on the \"Create route table\" button. For now, we will work with an existing route table on our VPC. Select the route table that you want to view the details or edit. \r\n\r\nAt the bottom panel, you will be able to view the following settings for the selected route table:\r\n\r\n - Summary\r\n - Routes\r\n - Subnet Associations\r\n - Edge Associations\r\n - Route Propagation\r\n - Tags\r\n\r\nYou can also either right-click on your route table or click on the Actions button to view the options related to this route table. Two options that we are interested in are:\r\n\r\n - Edit subnet associations\r\n - Edit routes\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15849309795e7820a34d1b6.png\" alt=\"Route Tables\">\r\n\r\nUnder the \"*Edit subnet associations*\" section, you can view the currently associated subnets. You can also link other subnets to the selected route table. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15849309875e7820ab3d05f.png\" alt=\"Edit subnet associations\">\r\n\r\nUnder the Edit routes option, you can edit the current routes and can also add new routes to the route table. A single route simply defines a Destination, Target, Status and Propagated. The destination is where the traffic (that originated in your subnet) is headed. A destination of \"**0.0.0.0\/0**\" means all traffic. Note that all zeros i.e. all traffic-related route should be the last one. These routes are evaluated in order. \r\n\r\nIf the traffic is destined for an IP address that is defined by 1st rule, then it will be sent to the device defined by the Target value of the route. The value \"*local*\" for the Target means to allow the traffic and keep it local, instead of sending anywhere else. You can also send the traffic to virtual appliances and gateways here.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15849309945e7820b27526d.png\" alt=\"Editing routes\">\r\n\r\nRoutes tables are very powerful in determining how the traffic will flow in your environment and should be designed appropriately and tested thoroughly. \r\n",

Next, you select your VPC from the list of all VPCs. As a best practice, you should provide names for all the VPCs. As you can see from the screenshot below, the first VPC has a name but the second one does not. To provide a name you can simply hover over that VPC in the name column and it will give you an option to edit and provide a new name.\r\n\r\nOnce you have selected your VPC, you can view it's Description, CIDR blocks, Flow logs and Tags related details at the bottom part of the screen. \r\n\r\nNext, you have your VPC selected, either right click on your VPC or click on the Actions menu at the top to view list of actions that you can perform on your VPC. One of this action is very useful. This is to \"**Edit CIDRs**\".\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15849298395e781c2f9d2e3.png\" alt=\"VPC Details\">\r\n\r\nWhile editing CIDRs, you can add a new CIDR by clicking on the \"Add IPv4 CIDR\" button. You will do this (for example) if the number of available IP addresses are enough and for increasing demand, you need to expand your VPC. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15849298465e781c36d1e08.png\" alt=\"Editing CIDRs\">\r\n\r\nFor every VPC you have multiple Subnets under that VPC. You can view these under the Subnets menu from the left. As a best practice, here too you should have a name for each of the subnets. As you can see from the below screenshot, only one subnet has a name. When you select a subnet you can view it's details in the bottom part of the screen. These details include:\r\n \r\n - Description\r\n - Flow Logs\r\n - Route Table\r\n - Network ACL\r\n - Tags\r\n - Sharing\r\n\r\nYou can also right-click on the selected subnet or click on the Actions button at the top to view the list of actions that you can perform on this subnet.

It provides connectivity between various EC2 instances in that network. It can also extend the connectivity to other networks or even on-premises. \r\n\r\n### Accessing VPCs and Launching Create Wizard###\r\n\r\nLet's start by creating one in AWS. We will first need to navigate to VPC from All services and then the \"Network & Content Delivery\" category. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15849240565e780598df108.png\" alt=\"VPC Option\">\r\n\r\nHere in the Dashboard (or even the VPC tab), click on the \"**Launch VPC Wizard**\" button to launch the wizard to create a new VPC.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15849240665e7805a246c69.png\" alt=\"Creating new VPC\">\r\n\r\n### Different Pre-packaged Networking Scenarios ###\r\n\r\nWhen the wizard launches to create a VPC, there are 4 pre-packaged scenarios to choose from. **Note** that these scenarios can be built by performing the settings manually and building VPCs separately. These are just like the starter packs (or pre-baked templates) to get you started. \r\n\r\nThe first one is to build a VPC with a Single Public Subnet. Here is the official description: \"Your instances run in a private, isolated section of the AWS cloud with direct access to the Internet. Network access control lists and security groups can be used to provide strict control over inbound and outbound network traffic to your instances.\"\r\n\r\nWhen you select this option it creates:\r\nA \/16 network with a \/24 subnet. Public subnet instances use Elastic IPs or Public IPs to access the Internet.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15849240735e7805a95187d.png\" alt=\"VPC with a Single Public subnet\">\r\n\r\nThe next one is to build a VPC with Public and Private subnets. Here is the official description: \"In addition to containing a public subnet, this configuration adds a private subnet whose instances are not addressable from the Internet. Instances in the private subnet can establish outbound connections to the Internet via the public subnet using Network Address Translation (NAT).\"\r\n\r\nWhen you select this option it creates:\r\nA \/16 network with two \/24 subnets. Public subnet instances use Elastic IPs to access the Internet. Private subnet instances access the Internet via Network Address Translation (NAT). (Hourly charges for NAT devices apply.)\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15849240805e7805b0a307c.png\" alt=\"VPC with Public and Private subnets\">\r\n\r\nThe 3rd one is to build a VPC with Public and Private subnets and Hardware VPN access. Here is the official description: \"This configuration adds an IPsec Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection between your Amazon VPC and your data center - effectively extending your data center to the cloud while also providing direct access to the Internet for public subnet instances in your Amazon VPC.\"\r\n\r\nWhen you select this option it creates:\r\nA \/16 network with two \/24 subnets. One subnet is directly connected to the Internet while the other subnet is connected to your corporate network via IPsec VPN tunnel. (VPN charges apply.)\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15849241235e7805dba8a4f.png\" alt=\"VPC with Public and Private subnets and Hardware VPN access\">\r\n\r\nThe last one is to build a VPC with a Private subnet only and Hardware VPN access. Here is the official description: \"Your instances run in a private, isolated section of the AWS cloud with a private subnet whose instances are not addressable from the Internet. You can connect this private subnet to your corporate data center via an IPsec Virtual Private Network (VPN) tunnel.\"\r\n\r\nWhen you select this option it creates:\r\nA \/16 network with a \/24 subnet and provisions an IPsec VPN tunnel between your Amazon VPC and your corporate network. (VPN charges apply.)\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15849241315e7805e346e2b.png\" alt=\"VPC with a Private subnet only and Hardware VPN access\">\r\n\r\nFor this post, I have selected the first scenario and clicked Next.\r\n\r\n### Providing Key Details for VPC ###\r\n\r\nIn the next screen, you provide all the essential details to create your VPC along with the dependent resources like it's subnets etc. These settings are as follows (numbering follows the numbers in the screenshot below):\r\n\r\n 1. IPv4 address space for the whole VPC. This is provided in the CIDR notation. \r\n 2. Once you enter the IP address space for the VPC, this area shows you the number of available IP addresses. These are the maximum number of network interfaces that can join this virtual network (or EC2 instances that have these network interfaces). Note that this number is a little less than total number of IP addresses in the CIDR notation. This is because some IP addresses are reserved by AWS for it's own functionality.\r\n 3. A name for the VPC to identify it\r\n 4. Subnet's IPv4 CIDR address space. This should be contained inside the CIDR for the VPC and should be smaller than that. A subnet is a sub-part of the VPC and therefore will have lesser number of IP addresses than the complete VPC.\r\n 5. A name for the subnet\r\n 6. Service Endpoint, that allows your VPC to connect to a service like S3. You can set this up at a later point if you need.\r\n 7. Enable DNS hostnames to allow DNS hostnames for the instances that can be connected using these hostnames instead of just IP addresses. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15849241385e7805ea3634b.png\" alt=\"Create VPC - all-important details\">\r\n\r\nOnce you are done configuring, hit create to create the VPC. Now that we have a VPC we will start working with it next.",

Both provide similar services with some differences in the implementation of these services. Microsoft has named it's service as \"**Virtual Networks**\", whereas Amazon calls its service as \"**Virtual Private Cloud**\" or most commonly called as \"**VPC**\".\r\n\r\nBoth Microsoft Azure Virtual Networks and AWS VPC have \"**Subnets**\" inside a network. The VMs in Azure or EC2 instances in AWS has network interfaces that connects to the subnets within the Virtual Networks (or VPCs) and receive an IP address from that subnet. The traffic route inside these networks is governed by \"**Route Tables**\". \r\n\r\nTraffic restrictions are implemented slightly differently in the two platforms. Microsoft Azure has \"**Network Security Groups**\". These can be applied at either Subnet or Virtual Machine level. Whereas AWS has **Network Access Control Lists** or **ACLs** that are applied at the subnet level. Also, AWS has **Security Groups** that are applied to the EC2 instances. \r\n\r\n### Accessing Microsoft Azure Virtual Networks ###\r\n\r\nTo view Virtual Networks in Azure, navigate to All services and then \"Virtual Networks\" under the Networking category.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15849220195e77fda35e356.png\" alt=\"Virtual Networks\">\r\n\r\n### Accessing AWS Virtual Private Clouds or VPCs ###\r\n\r\nTo view the VPCs, navigate to All Services and then click on VPC under the Networking category.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15849219905e77fd86c5057.png\" alt=\"VPCs\">\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will be looking at how to work with these services in detail in the next few posts. \r\n\r\nFor more information, click on the below official links:\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/virtual-network\/virtual-networks-overview\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Virtual Network<\/a>\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/vpc\/\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon Virtual Private Cloud<\/a>",

You can do both cross-region replication or same-region replication using the replication rules.\r\n\r\nTo begin, navigate to your S3 bucket and click on the \"**Management**\" tab. Then click on the \"**Replication**\" settings. Click on the \"**+ Add rule**\" to create a new rule.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15848372115e76b25b0c547.png\" alt=\"Replication\">\r\n\r\n**Pre-requisite**: Versioning is a pre-requisite on the S3 bucket for you to be able to set up replication.

This can be in the same region or a different region. This can even reside in a different account altogether.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15848372285e76b26c954f8.png\" alt=\"Destination bucket\">\r\n\r\nIf you don't have any bucket in the destination then you can create one right here while setting the destination.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15848372635e76b28fbd692.png\" alt=\"Creating new bucket in the destination\">\r\n\r\nWhile creating a new destination bucket, you can set its options like Storage class, object ownership, replication time control, etc.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15848372705e76b29622e78.png\" alt=\"Destination options\">\r\n\r\nNext up we have IAM role using which the data will be replicated.

After a certain period of time, you will either no longer need these objects or you may want to archive these. If we keep them lying and take actions manually then there are chances that we forget about these and end up paying for the extra space. **Lifecycle** within S3 buckets is a way to set an expiration date to the files and take automated actions at the expiration. \r\n\r\nTo start you navigate to your S3 bucket and go to the **Management** tab. Click on the Lifecycle here. To create a new lifecycle rule click on the \"*+Add lifecycle rule*\" button. A new popup launches to set up a new rule. You can have as many rules as you want.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15848362045e76ae6c6e798.png\" alt=\"Add lifecycle rules\">\r\n\r\nTo set up a lifecycle rule, set up a name for this rule.

This launches the **upload files** wizard. Simply drag and drop your files and folders here to start the upload.\r\n\r\nYou not only just upload files but set some properties to it that we will visit next. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15848294755e769423ecc98.png\" alt=\"Uploading file\">\r\n\r\nNext, you set the **permissions** for the uploaded files.

Standard is the default option. There are various other options that you can choose from based on your performance and cost requirements. Glacier storage tier is for the archival data, that is not available immediately but you can keep it archived for a long period of time. **Note** that you are billed based on your selection here so make sure that you select the appropriate Storage class.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15848295135e76944953802.png\" alt=\"Setting properties\">\r\n\r\nScroll down to view more properties for **Encryption**, **Metadata**, and **Tagging**.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15848295205e76945073b50.png\" alt=\"More properties\">\r\n\r\nFinally, review all the settings and hit the Upload button to upload the files. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15848295275e76945788722.png\" alt=\"Review and upload\">\r\n\r\nOnce the files are uploaded, you can select on each of these files and access a lot of actions from the \"Actions\" menu.

Let's look at these in a systematic way:\r\n\r\n 1. First, you can either leave the access open to all networks or limit it to a specific virtual network. If you select the latter option, you should also select your virtual network for which you want to provide access. You do so by clicking on the \"+Add existing virtual network\" option. It will open up a new blade and here you can find your existing vNet and add the same.\r\n 2. Next, you configure the Firewall and add IP addresses or a range of IP addresses (in CIDR format) for which the access needs to be opened up\r\n 3. Finally, you have the exceptions. Unless the data is very critical and confidential, I recommend that you should always allow access to the Microsoft services by selecting the first checkbox. It should be automatically checked by default. You can also allow access to storage account logging and metrics from any network here.\r\n\r\nFirewall and vNet access is generally overlooked option.

There are two primary ways to securely access your storage accounts. In this post, we will review these and find out how to access their settings from the portal.\r\n\r\n### Access Keys ###\r\n\r\nThe first is to use the **Access keys**. Linked to every storage account, there are two access keys. These are referred to as primary and secondary keys or simply key1 and key2. To access these keys, navigate to your storage account and then click on the \"Access keys\" under settings. Note that you only need one key (anyone) to be able to connect to the storage account. Now when you are using a tool like Storage Explorer or PowerShell scripts to connect to your storage account, you can use this key along with the name of the storage account to connect and perform operations. \r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15848161415e76600dcfaa4.png\" alt=\"Access Keys\">\r\n\r\n**Note** that these keys are like keys to the kingdom for your storage accounts. You can't tweak the control and restrict it in any way. These keys are meant only for the administrators and should not be used by anyone else. You also can't set any kind of expiry on these keys. So once somebody has these keys they can keep on using these to access the storage accounts. The only way to change is to access the keys and click on the refresh arrow symbol next to the key1 or key2 text to regenerate these keys. As a best practice, you should always use SAS tokens i.e. Shared Access Signature keys to perform any operations.\r\n\r\n### Shared Access Signature (SAS tokens) ###\r\n\r\nSAS tokens are the way you should be accessing the storage accounts, programmatically or otherwise. These are what you should be using (with an expiry date) to give temporary access to anybody in your organization or even outside if there is any sensitive data on your storage accounts. \r\n\r\nFrom official page: \"A shared access signature (SAS) is a ***URI*** that grants restricted access rights to Azure Storage resources. You can provide a shared access signature to clients who should not be trusted with your storage account key but whom you wish to delegate access to certain storage account resources. By distributing a shared access signature URI to these clients, you grant them access to a resource for a specified period of time. An account-level SAS can delegate access to multiple storage services (i.e. blob, file, queue, table). Note that stored access policies are currently not supported for an account-level SAS.\"\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15847709465e75af829cea1.png\" alt=\"Shared access signature\">\r\n\r\nOnce you tweak all the settings for what kind of access you want to provide, then click on \"Generate SAS and connection string\" it will generate a Shared Access Signature (SAS token), and a connection string and various URIs using that SAS token. These URIs for storage account's blob, file share, tables and queue services. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15848180835e7667a3f1e03.png\" alt=\"Shared access signature Connection string and URLs\">\r\n\r\nNow you know the best way to connect to your storage accounts securely. Depending upon your situation ensure to use the correct approach. If in confusion, always go with Shared Access Signatures. \r\n",

You can automate these events and can take action when these events occur. \r\n\r\nBuild reactive, event-driven apps with a fully managed event routing service that is built into Azure. Event Grid helps you build automation into your cloud infrastructure, create serverless apps, and integrate across services and clouds.\r\n\r\nFew examples could be:\r\n\r\n - When a user uploads a large video file, a time-to-live value is assigned to that file and that file can either be archived or deleted after that time. \r\n - If some image is uploaded then immediately you can run Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on the image and can capture the data into a database.\r\n - If someone uploads a document file then automatically that is processed and the details captured can be input into a database if the document adheres to a certain format\r\n - Generating transcripts for video uploads etc. \r\n\r\nNote that this feature is available out of the box in V2 storage accounts. To access, simply navigate to your storage account resource and click on the Events option. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15847641095e7594cd8119f.png\" alt=\"Even driven automation\">\r\n\r\nThe solution actually leverages other Azure resources to provide this automation. Some of these include:\r\n\r\n 1. Azure **Event Grid** - it has built-in support for events coming from Azure Storage blobs\r\n 2. Azure **Logic Apps** (serverless workflow and integration)\r\n 3. Azure **Functions** (serverless code)\r\n\r\nYou create a subscription to Event Grid. It receives the event notification and passes the information to the handlers to take some actions. Logic Apps and Azure Functions are two such handlers where you can write the automation. We will delve deeper with an example in a future post.",

Microsoft has bundled below services within Storage Accounts:\r\n\r\n - **Blob storage** - to securely store your blobs like photos, videos, and other files, etc.\r\n - **File shares** - SMB file shares\r\n - **Table storage** - Tabular storage to store non-relational data\r\n - **Queue storage** - to scale apps\r\n\r\nThese are very similar to the AWS S3 buckets.\r\n\r\nTo access Microsoft Azure Storage Accounts, navigate to All services -> Storage category -> Storage accounts. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15847321445e7517f07eece.png\" alt=\"Storage accounts\">\r\n\r\nHere you can view all your existing storage accounts (if you have any). Click on the \"+Add\" button to create a new Storage account.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15847481625e75568229207.png\" alt=\"Add new Storage Account\">\r\n\r\nFor the basic settings, start with selecting the right subscription and creating or using an existing Resource Group.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15847481685e755688bae7a.png\" alt=\"Basic settings\">\r\n\r\nProvide a name for the storage account. The name can only contain small letters and have to be unique in Microsoft DNS space. Select the geo location for the deployment. Next, you have the performance setting between standard and premium.\r\n\r\nYou also select between the two account kinds. There is version 1 and version 2. For all new storage accounts select Version 2.\r\n\r\nYou decide the replication strategy and select the type of storage account based on the replication. You have options like Zone redundant storage (ZRS), Locally redundant storage (LRS), Globally redundant storage (GRS) and Read Accessible - Globally redundant storage (RA-GRS). For maximum replication, select RA-GRS.\r\n\r\nNext, decide if you want Hot or Cool access tier. The default is Hot. Cool is for archival storage. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15847481765e755690cf5e2.png\" alt=\"Instance details\">\r\n\r\nUnder networking you have 3 options for connectivity:\r\n\r\n - Public endpoint (all networks)\r\n - Public endpoint (selected networks)\r\n - Private endpoint\r\n\r\nThe private endpoint is the latest option that assigns a network interface (and therefore a private IP address) to your storage account. With this you can access your storage account leveraging the nic card, securely from your virtual network, as if it was just another resource on that network.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15847481845e75569840199.png\" alt=\"Networking Details\">\r\n\r\nUnder advanced settings, you select the security, large file shares, data protection, data lake storage etc.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15847515165e75639c25286.png\" alt=\"Advanced settings\">\r\n\r\nYou can apply tags next to categorize the resource. It is optional but is highly recommended as a best practice.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15847515235e7563a323b9b.png\" alt=\"Tags\">\r\n\r\nFinally, review and create the storage account.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15847515295e7563a98bbc4.png\" alt=\"Review and Create\">\r\n\r\n",

It is the storage optimized for I\/O intensive read\/write operations. For use as high-performance Azure virtual machine storage. Microsoft Azure offering is called \"**Managed disk**\" whereas AWS calls it \"**Elastic Block Store (EBS) Volume**\". \r\n\r\n### AWS - Elastic Block Store (EBS) Volume ###\r\n\r\nLet's look at AWS's offering first. When you create EC2 instances, you automatically get at least one volume (i.e. disk) for the OS disk. You can additionally add multiple volumes for the data disk. You can view all this data by navigating to EC2 and then under the settings go to the \"Elastic Block Store\" category. You will find your **Volumes** listed here. \r\n\r\nThere is also an option to view the **Snapshots** which shows you any snapshots taken on the volume, taken manually or from AWS Backup service.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15846787265e7447469a267.png\" alt=\"Elastic Block Store (EBS) Volume\">\r\n\r\n### Microsoft Azure Managed disks ###\r\n\r\nWithin Microsoft Azure, the disks of Virtual Machines or VMs used to be VHD files sitting on a Storage account (similar to S3 bucket). Microsoft upgraded its offering to Managed Disks with loads of granular controls and optimizations. These disks can be switched from standard HDD to premium SDD by just switching a value from a dropdown. You can also control role-based access control of individual disks (a feature that was not available before in Microsoft Azure). \r\n\r\nYou can find the managed disks under All services -> Compute category. Click on Disks to view all the disks in your environment. \r\n\r\nIf you want to view a specific disk on your VM then you can also navigate to your virtual machine and then find the Disks setting. The OS and any data disks will also be listed there. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15846787485e74475c6b65d.png\" alt=\"Managed Disks\">\r\n\r\nWhen you click on any one of the managed disk, it takes you to the overview page and you can see various details about the disk including the \"Owner VM\" to which this disk is connected. You can directly take a snapshot of the disk from here.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15846787545e7447627a2b4.png\" alt=\"Overview and Create Snapshot\">\r\n\r\nUnder settings of the disk, one notable setting is the **Configuration** of the disk. You can quickly select the Storage type and Size of the disk. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15846787605e74476830e4b.png\" alt=\"Storage type and size\">\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information, please use these links:\r\n\r\n - <a href=\"https:\/\/azure.microsoft.com\/en-us\/services\/storage\/disks\/\" target=\"_blank\">Azure managed disks<\/a>\r\n - <a href=\"https:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/ebs\/?ebs-whats-new.sort-by=item.additionalFields.postDateTime&ebs-whats-new.sort-order=desc\" target=\"_blank\">Elastic Block Store (EBS)<\/a>",

You can either choose one of the AWS recommended settings to optimize performance or cost or both. Or you can also define your own custom scaling conditions. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou start by navigating to the AWS Auto Scaling by going to All Services and then navigating to the Management and Governance section.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15846760855e743cf508966.png\" alt=\"AWS Auto Scaling\">\r\n\r\nYou can create multiple scaling plans here.

You can do so in various ways. You can search for resources on the AWS CloudFormation stack. Or you can search by Tags applied to the resources. Or you can directly select EC2 Auto Scaling groups. \r\n\r\nAs shown below, we have selected our auto scaling group, that we created in one of the previous blog posts. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15846761005e743d0417140.png\" alt=\"Finding Scalable resources\">\r\n\r\nIn the next step, you have the option to specify the scaling strategy. You start by providing a name and then scroll down for more details. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15846761065e743d0a6c3da.png\" alt=\"Specify Scaling Strategy\">\r\n\r\nYou can either select one of the predefined auto scaling strategies optimized for availability or cost or both. You can even define your own Custom strategy and have more granular control over these settings. \r\n\r\nExpand the Configuration details to view the applied settings. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15846761435e743d2f179b0.png\" alt=\"Selecting or Defining the Scaling Strategy\">\r\n\r\nNext up you have various advanced settings like dynamic scaling and predictive scaling. To configure, first, select your auto scaling group and then expand the category you want to tweak. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15846761505e743d364c23a.png\" alt=\"Advanced Settings\">\r\n\r\nFinally, you review all the settings and create your scaling plan. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15846761565e743d3cc39bf.png\" alt=\"Review and Create\">\r\n\r\nOnce the scaling plan is ready, it will do most of the heavy lifting for you by automating the scaling in and scaling out of the instances based on the scaling strategies defined in your plan. \r\n\r\n",

I recommend having a \"Target tracking scaling policy\". There are different criteria that you can configure. In the screenshot below, you have the policy based on the average CPU utilization.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15846744325e7436803c007.png\" alt=\"Optional scaling policies\">\r\n\r\nYou can configure various notifications on your auto scaling group next. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15846744395e7436875ccda.png\" alt=\"Notifications\">\r\n\r\nFinally, you have the option to configure tags on the auto scaling group.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15846744735e7436a98e19d.png\" alt=\"Tags\">\r\n\r\nReview all the settings and create the auto scaling group.

This helps you tweak the autoscaling settings of your VMSS. You should monitor this continuously for any critical applications in your environment. Ideally, to begin with, this should be done in a test or QA environment with a simulated load on your application running for a long period of time. And then you should keep doing this in upper environments as a best practice. \r\n\r\nTo access this setting, navigate to your VM scale set and navigate to the \"Scaling\" option under the Settings menu. Here click on the \"**Run history**\" tab. All the history for how the instances were scaled up and down will be visible here. You can filter the data based on time to reduce the window. At the bottom you also have Operations list view what operations occurred on the VMSS and at what times. \r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15845936465e72faeeb9450.png\" alt=\"Scaling Run History\">\r\n\r\nThis option should be used in conjunction with the performance data for the app or workloads running on your VMSS for a complete picture. If you view any performance drops, you should tweak the settings to scale out earlier than what it is configured. E.g. If the scale out operation is configured if the Average CPU percentage goes above 75% and you still see performance hits, then you should tweak that setting from 75% to a lower value like 65%. \r\n\r\nThere may also be some times during the day or week when there will be more load on your application. To ease this, you can add a schedule for scaling based on time. Note that there is no single best combination. The best settings for you depends upon your application. \r\n",

You have the option to either set the scaling settings manually or set them to auto-scale based on different criteria. \r\n\r\nTo access these settings, navigate to your VMSS and go to the **Scaling** option under Settings. Ensure that \"Custom autoscale\" is selected. Then click on the \"**Configure**\" button from the top.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15845924135e72f61d7810a.png\" alt=\"Scaling configurations\">\r\n\r\nIn the next screen, you can \"scale based on a metric\" to scale based on different metrics on the VM. Examples of such metrics include CPU percentage, Memory consumption, etc. Here you define: \r\n\r\n - **Scale out** - This is the setting for how the instance count should *increase*. E.g. if the Average CPU percentage increases beyond 75% then increase the count by 1.\r\n - **Scale in** - This is the setting for how the instance count should *decrease*. E.g. if the Average CPU percentage decreases below 25% then decrease the count by 1.\r\n\r\nYou also have the option to scale to a specific instance count based on a time schedule.\r\n\r\nAnother setting you have control over here is to set the **Instance Limits**. You define a minimum and a maximum number of instances with what the default or an initial number of instances is going to be. Note that the default value can only be between a minimum and a maximum number of instances. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15845924185e72f622efeb6.png\" alt=\"Scaling rules\">\r\n\r\nAnother key point to note is that you can add multiple scaling conditions to ensure autoscaling occurs as you require. Now that you have the autoscaling set up, next you should simulate load on your application running on VMSS and validate that you are not facing any performance issues. If you do then you should tweak the autoscaling numbers.",

Let's dive right in.\r\n\r\nIn continuation of the creation of VMSS wizard, next up you have the **Scaling** options. You provide the initial instance count. If you want to set up autoscaling, I recommend you to set up Custom policy rather than manual. You can automate based on various conditions like CPU exceeding certain thresholds etc. You can also tweak these settings once the VMSS has been set up and can add multiple criteria.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15845877715e72e3fb7a2ce.png\" alt=\"Scaling Options\">\r\n\r\nNext, you have Management settings. Here you can provide Upgrade policies, set up monitoring for diagnostics, Identity, Automatic OS upgrades, Instance termination notifications etc. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15845877795e72e40354599.png\" alt=\"Management settings\">\r\n\r\nTo monitor health, you can set up rules here. E.g. Let's say you have a web app running on the VMs in VMSS. You can set to monitor health by monitoring port HTTP 80 at a particular path of the app running on your workloads.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15845896975e72eb811e4d8.png\" alt=\"Monitoring Health\">\r\n\r\nVarious advanced settings can be set up on the next screen. If you are running Linux VMs in your VMSS then you can leverage \"Cloud init\" to automate the configurations on the start-up of every new instance in VMSS. Proximity placement groups ensure that the different instances in your VMSS are deployed closer to each other physically in a datacenter. \r\n\r\nYou can also decide between the VM generation etc. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15845897035e72eb874aa00.png\" alt=\"Advanced settings\">\r\n\r\nYou can provide Tags next to better categorize the resources. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15845897085e72eb8ccda8e.png\" alt=\"Tags\">\r\n\r\nFinally, you review all the settings and hit Create to create the VMSS.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15845897145e72eb9290347.png\" alt=\"Review and Create\">\r\n\r\n",

These VMs are load-balanced internally and the load is also managed automatically for you. You can define various autoscaling schedules to scale your resources up and down based on the demand. E.g. if Average CPU percentage increases beyond a number then you can automate to increase the number of running instances i.e. scale up. Similarly, you can configure to reduce the instances i.e. scale down if the average CPU percentage goes down a certain number. This auto-scaling is provided out of the box with VMSS. \r\n\r\nLet's start working with VMSS by creating one.\r\n\r\nYou will find VMSS under the **Compute** category.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15845631905e7283f6d0d93.png\" alt=\"VMSS under All Services\">\r\n\r\nWhen in the blade for VMSS, click on the \"+Add\" button\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15845631995e7283ffe9bdf.png\" alt=\"Adding a new VMSS\">\r\n\r\nProvide the subscription and Resource Group just like for any other resource creation in Azure. Provide a name for the VMSS, a region where it will be deployed and Availability set if you want any.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15845659695e728ed10ab92.png\" alt=\"Creating VMSS - Basics\">\r\n\r\nNext, you provide the Instance details. This is very important. This is the underlying Image and it's compute size. This is the consumption that you will be having in your VMSS based on the number of instances running.\r\n\r\nYou also provide authentication information for connectivity.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15845659755e728ed77de6f.png\" alt=\"Creating VMSS - More Basics\">\r\n\r\nNext, we need to provide the disk details (just like for a single VM). Here you can decide the type of disk to use for OS disk. You can also create and attach data disks here.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15845659805e728edcda944.png\" alt=\"Creating VMSS - Disk related options\">\r\n\r\nNext up we have networking details. You provide information regarding which virtual network the underlying VMs will be connected to in this VMSS. You also provide the Network Interface that VMSS will be using for connectivity.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15845659885e728ee482698.png\" alt=\"Creating VMSS - Networking details\">\r\n\r\nIn part 2 we will continue with the wizard and setting up of VMSS. \r\n\r\n",

The demand for the service and therefore the load on your applications will vary based on various factors. It will vary as per:\r\n\r\n - The time of the day\r\n - The day of the month\r\n - Any holidays\r\n - Any special events etc. \r\n\r\nYour application needs to scale out or scale in based on the dynamic demands. You can NOT find a perfect mix and pre-determine the exact number of instances (of Virtual machines or EC2) that you need to run. If you will define the lower number then the performance will suffer. On the other hand, if you overestimate then you will be looking at costly bills. You always want to optimize between **Cost** and **Performance**. \r\n\r\nThis is where Autoscaling comes into the picture. With this, you can have rules in place that will automatically scale out or scale in your number of instances running the application. \r\n\r\nAs a **pre-requisite**, you need to have the application which can be deployed on multiple instances behind a load-balancer. \r\n\r\nBoth Azure and AWS provide out of the box services for this functionality. In both platforms, you can define rules as to how the scaling should occur in an automated fashion. E.g. you can have the number of instances increase by 1 if the average CPU percentage usage increases more than 75%. And also another rule for decreasing the number of instances by 1 if the average CPU percentage usage reduces below 25%. \r\n\r\n**Microsoft Azure** has package everything into one service called **Virtual Machine Scale Set** or more popularly known as **VMSS**. Even the automation for autoscaling is also built directly into this service and is as easy as setting up a few configurations. \r\n\r\n**Amazon's AWS** also has this capability, although this is scattered over different services. These include:\r\n\r\n - Launch Configurations - a pre-packaged set of configurations that define how to set up new EC2 instances\r\n - Launch Templates - newer way to do the same thing as Launch Configurations. These have more features like versioning, etc.\r\n - Auto Scaling Groups - a load-balanced group of EC2 instances\r\n - AWS Auto Scaling - a newer service providing the automation for scaling out and scaling in of EC2 instances\r\n\r\nWe will be working on these services in the next few posts and taking a closer look at each of these.",

This is the main work that you are trying to accomplish e.g. processing an image.\r\n - **Job Queue** - When you submit a job, it is sent to a job queue. This has linked compute resources. **AWS Batch Scheduler** places the job on a compute resource within a compute resource environment\r\n - **Compute Environment** - This is the logical grouping of compute resources i.e. EC2 instances that can receive jobs from a job queue\r\n\r\nAWS Batch automatically scales out your compute resources when there are jobs to work upon. It later scales it back when the job queue is empty.\r\n\r\n### Working with the Service ###\r\n\r\nAWS Batch service can be found under all Services and then navigating to the Compute category. Click on **Batch** to launch the AWS Batch service.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15844277715e7072fb5c4a9.png\" alt=\"AWS Batch Service\">\r\n\r\nHere you are presented with the default \"**Getting Started**\" screen.  It gives you an overview of how the service works. \r\n\r\nClicking on the Getting Started button takes you to the wizard to set up the service.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15844277935e707311769a0.png\" alt=\"Getting Started\">\r\n\r\nFirst, you define the Job and its details. You start with where you want to run your job and defining a run time for the job.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15844278105e707322dfe0c.png\" alt=\"Defining the Job and it's Runtime\">\r\n\r\nNext, you provide the container properties for the job. The command you define is what is executed when this job is run. This is where you define what compute power will be required to run the job. E.g. 2 vCPUs and 2000 MiB of Memory. You also define the number of attempts to be made to run the job successfully. Job Execution timeout is another thing you define here in the number of seconds. If the job does not finish up in this time then it is stopped and moved to the Failed queue.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15844278255e70733101239.png\" alt=\"Container Properties\">\r\n\r\nYou can optionally define parameters and environment variables as well. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15844278375e70733d56135.png\" alt=\"Job Parameters and Environment Variables\">\r\n\r\nUnder **Step 2**, you define the compute environment and set up the Job queue. Compute environment is where the job is run. You define its behavior in this section. You can choose between:\r\n\r\n - **On-Demand** - for any critical and business impacting jobs. This is most predictable\r\n - **Spot** - very cost-effective option. The cost savings are up to 90% of the On-demand option. It uses the EC2 Spot instances to do so.\r\n\r\nYou can also define a minimum, desired and a maximum number of vCPUs here.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15844278495e70734941b33.png\" alt=\"Compute Environment\">\r\n\r\nYou set up your networking next. Also, this is where you define the Job Queue and link it to the Compute environment. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15844278605e707354139bf.png\" alt=\"Networking for Compute Environment and Job Queue\">\r\n\r\nHit **Create** and you should be all set. AWS creates the underlying resources and shows you the status. \r\n\r\n### Viewing the Resources and Logs ###\r\n\r\nYou can now navigate to the Dashboard and view the newly created resources.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15844692465e7114fe97480.png\" alt=\"AWS Batch Dashboard\"> \r\n\r\nYou can navigate to the Jobs section and find your job that was executed. It will look like a guid. Click on this job. In the popup, click on \"**View logs**\". This will take you to the CloudWatch window and will show you the logs.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15844695395e71162355651.png\" alt=\"Log for the Jobs\"> \r\n\r\n\r\nThat's all there is to it. You can define simple jobs like execute some applications to very complex jobs like image and video processing.\r\n\r\nFor more information check these link: \r\n\r\n - <a href=\"https:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/batch\/\" target=\"_blank\">AWS Batch service<\/a>",

Within this Batch account, we create a **Pool**. Next, we create a **Job** that runs on this Pool. Finally, every Job has multiple **Tasks** that are actually executed within the Job (and on the Pool)\r\n\r\nIn this post, we will create on such Task in a Job. \r\n\r\nTo create a Task, you begin by navigating to your Batch account (if not there already). Next click on the Jobs option under the Features category. Find your job and click on the same.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15843974675e6ffc9b9660f.png\" alt=\"Navigating to Jobs\">\r\n\r\nWithin the job, find the Tasks menu and click on that. You will see \"+Add\" option here to add a new Task.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15843974735e6ffca175d8f.png\" alt=\"Tasks section\">\r\n\r\nNext, a wizard will open up to add a new Task. Here primarily you provide a task Id, display name and Command line. Note, that this command line is where you specify what to run. \r\n\r\nA simple command line may look like below. This displays the Batch environment variable and then waits for 180 seconds. This is used in the screenshots and later output.\r\n\r\n  `cmd \/c \"set AZ_BATCH & timeout \/t 180 > NUL\"`\r\n\r\nA more complex command line, to execute an app package may look like:\r\n\r\n  `cmd \/c %AZ_BATCH_APP_PACKAGE_app01#1.0%\\\\myapp.exe`\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15843974795e6ffca706a55.png\" alt=\"Add Task wizard\">\r\n\r\nYou can configure more settings like environment settings, task dependencies, and Application packages etc. Hit Submit when ready to create the Task.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15843975025e6ffcbe8536b.png\" alt=\"More settings\">\r\n\r\nTo check the output of the task execution we will check the output stream. Navigate to your task. And then under the \"**Task Files**\" section click on the \"**Files on node**\" option. Here you will find the \"**stdout.txt**\" file. Click on this file to view the output.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15843975075e6ffcc3b3739.png\" alt=\"Checking the output\">\r\n\r\nThe output stream (for the simple command line from above) will look like below.

You can do so right from the settings of the VM. Under the hood it uses **Azure Site Recovery** to set up this disaster recovery.\r\n\r\nNavigate to your VM and under the Operations category, click on the \"**Disaster recovery**\". Here you can select the Target region for the replication. This region becomes your secondary location and should be factored in your Disaster Recovery strategy. E.g. There should be appropriate infrastructure in place to allow for connectivity to this secondary location. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15843419925e6f23e8d325d.png\" alt=\"Disaster Recovery for a VM\">\r\n\r\nNext, you have Advanced Settings for the Disaster Recovery. You can select the settings for the **Target**, i.e. what the Resource Group, Virtual Network etc. is going to be in the target region, if we failover the VM to that region. You also have **Storage** settings, where you define the cache storage account (used to replicate the managed disks) and the source to target managed disk mappings. \r\n\r\nReplication and Extension settings can also be updated here if you require. I recommend that under Replication settings you ensure that the vault selected is appropriate one if you have more than one vaults in your environment. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15843419995e6f23ef8d7d2.png\" alt=\"DR advanced settings\">\r\n\r\nFinally, review all the settings and start the replication by click on the button as shown below.

You can trigger Failover if anything goes wrong in the primary region. Once the DR even is over, you can also Failback to the original location.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information check this link: <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/site-recovery\/azure-to-azure-quickstart\" target=\"_blank\">Set up disaster recovery to a secondary Azure region for an Azure VM<\/a>",

This is a fully managed, centralized backup service simplifying the management of your backups for your Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes, your databases (Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) or Amazon DynamoDB), AWS Storage Gateway and your Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) filesystems. \r\n\r\n### Configuring Backup Plans ###\r\n\r\nTo be able to use AWS Backup you need Backup Plans configured and created. \r\n\r\nLet's first navigate to the service by going to **Services** and then \"**AWS Backup**\" service under the Storage category.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15843315955e6efb4bd033b.png\" alt=\"AWS Backup service navigation\">\r\n\r\nWhen you launch this service for the very first time, you are provided with loads of information regarding the service. The first thing that you need to do is to create a **Backup Plan**. Click on the button to \"***Create Backup plan***\".\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15843316025e6efb524ea63.png\" alt=\"Creating Backup plan\">\r\n\r\nYou can either start from an existing plan (to copy all it's settings) or build a new plan. If you don't have anything configured then you will have to select the option to Build a new plan. Provide a name for the plan and scroll down.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15843316225e6efb66b1ab8.png\" alt=\"Building a new plan\">\r\n\r\nNext, provide the Backup rule configurations. With every backup plan, you can have multiple backup rules. Basically, these define when a backup is taken, how often it is taken, when does this backup expires and so on. You start by specifying a name for the rule. Then you specify a Schedule for the backup. The options include Daily, Weekly, Monthly etc. You can also customize the backup window, i.e. at what hour of the day the backup is taken.\r\n\r\nUnder **Lifecycle**, you define when the backup should transition to Cold storage and when it should expire. You also select a Vault for the backup. This is the vault resource where the recovery points created by the Backup service are organized. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15843316275e6efb6be8850.png\" alt=\"Backup rule configuration\">\r\n\r\nNext, you can copy the backup to multiple regions. In this way you get redundancy. If the backup primary region goes down, you can use the copy from a different region to restore.\r\n\r\nHere you also specify the Tags to add to a backup plan to organize and categorize this in a better way. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15843316355e6efb731b88c.png\" alt=\"Copy to region and tags settings\">\r\n\r\nClick on the \"**Create plan**\" button once done. As you can see from the two notes above, once the plan is created, you can assign resources to this backup plan. We want to add our EC2 instance to this plan. We will do this in the next blog post. \r\n\r\nFor more information please check this link: \r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/backup\/?nc2=h_ql_prod_st_bu\" target=\"_blank\">AWS Backup<\/a>",

But this is also one of the most ignored aspects of the deployment. This performance measurement of your OS and Data Disks can alter your experience significantly. Let's see how it differs in the two platforms.\r\n\r\n## In AWS ##\r\n\r\n - For **Provisioned IOPS (SSD)** volumes, you can provision up to 50 IOPS per GiB. Provisioned IOPs (SSD) volumes can deliver up to 64000 IOPS and are best for EBS-optimized instances.  \r\n - For **General Purpose (SSD)** volumes, baseline performance is 3 IOPS per GiB, with a minimum of 100 IOPS and a maximum of 16000 IOPS. General Purpose (SSD) volumes\r\n   under 1000 GiB can burst up to 3000 IOPS. \r\n - **Magnetic volumes**, previously called standard volumes, deliver 100 IOPS on average and\r\n   can burst into hundreds of IOPS.\r\n\r\nIf you remember when we were building the EC2 instances, you have the option to add\/tweak the storage in Step 4. Here you can see that you can select between the different type of Storage disks that we discussed above.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15843064775e6e992deb746.png\" alt=\"AWS1 - Adding Storage\">\r\n\r\nWhen you select the \"*Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1)*\" option, the column for IOPS turns into a text box and you can tweak the IOPS to your hearts' content. Please note that you can not go beyond 50 IOPS per GiB. E.g. If the disk you selected is 8 GiB in Size then you can't go beyond a maximum of 400 IOPS (i.e. 8x50). \r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15843064855e6e9935a9a3a.png\" alt=\"AWS2 - Provisioned IOPS\">\r\n\r\n## In Azure ##\r\n\r\n - **Premium SSD disks** offer high-performance, low-latency disk support for I\/O-intensive applications and production workloads. \r\n - **Standard SSD Disks** is a cost-effective storage option optimized for workloads that need consistent performance at lower IOPS levels. \r\n - Use **Standard HDD** disks for Dev\/Test scenarios and less critical workloads at the lowest cost.\r\n\r\nYou can directly update the type of disk for OS under the second screen of the Virtual Machine creation wizard i.e. under the Disks category. You can select between the three types. The OS Disk size is determined by the VM Size selected. This can be increased later. You can click on \"Create and attach a new disk\" link and add a Data Disk to the VM.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15843065145e6e99523d907.png\" alt=\"Az1 Storage Types\">\r\n\r\nIn the \"Create a new disk\" wizard, you can change the size of the disk. Now here you are shown based on the size, how much IOPS you will get. Microsoft defines different tiers and provides IOPS based on the tier selected i.e. based on the disk size selected. \r\n\r\nBelow you see the IOPS for **Premium SSD** tiers.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15843065925e6e99a0ab239.png\" alt=\"Az2 \">\r\n\r\nBelow you see the IOPS for **Standard SSD** tiers.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15843066025e6e99aa74b35.png\" alt=\"Az3 \">\r\n\r\nBelow you see the IOPS for **Standard HDD** tiers.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15843066145e6e99b6ba2ee.png\" alt=\"Az4 \">\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information, refer to the below links:\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/virtual-machines\/linux\/managed-disks-overview\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Azure managed disks<\/a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/AWSEC2\/latest\/UserGuide\/ebs-volume-types.html\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon EBS Volume Types<\/a>",

You can view all posts in this series here:<b> <a href=\"https:\/\/HarvestingClouds.com\/post\/azure-for-aws-professionals-index\" target=\"_blank\">Azure for AWS professionals - Index<\/a><\/b>\r\n\r\nIn the previous post, we covered how to create EC2 instances in AWS. You can revisit that post here: <a href=\"https:\/\/HarvestingClouds.com\/post\/azure-for-aws-professionals-virtual-machines-vs-ec2-instances-02-creating-ec2-instances\/\" target=\"_blank\">Creating EC2 Instances in AWS<\/a>\r\n\r\nIn this post, we will check how to create a Virtual Machine in Azure. If you know one, it is very easy to translate the information to another platform. The essential part is to look out for the quirks of each platform and note how these differ from each other. Let's dive in.\r\n\r\nYou can create the VM resource in one of the two ways. Either by navigating to \"*Create a resource*\" and then finding the VM you want to build. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15843034905e6e8d82e484b.png\" alt=\"1 Create a resource\">\r\n\r\nOr you can navigate to the VMs section and then click on the **Add** button to build the VM.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15843034975e6e8d89a4c41.png\" alt=\"2 Add a VM\">\r\n\r\nYou are presented with the \"Create a virtual machine\" wizard. Here you ensure that the subscription and the resource group is correct. **Subscription** is how to buy and use Azure. You have different plans like \"Pay as you go\" when subscribing to Azure. **Resource Groups** are nothing but a logical grouping of resources in Azure. \r\n\r\nYou also provide the Instance details like the name of the VM, the region where the VM will be deployed, any redundancy options etc.\r\n\r\nYou select the VM image that you want to build e.g. Windows Server 2016 Datacenter. This is similar to selecting the AMI or Amazon machine image in AWS. The Size decides how many vCPUs and Memory in GiB is allocated to the VM. This is also how you will be billed per month for the VM. Note that you only pay when the VM is running. If the VM is in Stopped and Deallocated state then you are not charged for the Compute consumption of the VM. Then you are only charged for the storage component of the VM.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15843035325e6e8dacf35ce.png\" alt=\"3_1 Creating a VM\">\r\n\r\nWhen you scroll down, this is also where you provide the credentials to be used with the VM. You also configure allowed ports for the VM. E.g. RDP is opened here. You can tweak this further in the Networking section ahead.\r\n\r\nThe biggest difference here is that, if you own a Windows license on-premises then you can leverage that to **save up to 49%** in Azure via Azure Hybrid Benefit.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15843035705e6e8dd294530.png\" alt=\"3_1 Creating a VM\">\r\n\r\nNext, you select the VM disks. Here based on your selection you get faster and slower IOPS. You can also add new or existing disks as data disks.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15843035815e6e8ddde551f.png\" alt=\"4 VM Disks\">\r\n\r\nIn the networking section, you can select an existing Virtual network or create a new one. You can select subnets within that network or create a new one as well. Same goes for the Public IP. This is also where you can tweak the network security group.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15843035995e6e8def01069.png\" alt=\"5 VM Networking\">\r\n\r\nUnder the management section, you can configure Monitoring options. You can also configure Auto-shutdown configurations on the VM as well.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15843036465e6e8e1e54144.png\" alt=\"6 VM Management\">\r\n\r\nUnder Advanced settings, you can install Microsoft or Third party extensions like Chef, Puppet etc. You can also automate one time installations in your linux VMs via Cloud init. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15843036705e6e8e36f01e4.png\" alt=\"7 Advanced settings\">\r\n\r\nNext, you can assign Tags to categorize the resources. These come in very handy when creating billing reports. Note that not just the VM but underlying resources like OS and Data disks, network interface cards, etc. will also be tagged.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15843037255e6e8e6d768e8.png\" alt=\"8 Adding Tags\">\r\n\r\nFinally, you can review the settings. Azure also gives you the option to \"Download a template for automation\". This is your ARM Template including the JSON file, that you can leverage to automate or replicate the deployment of the instance multiple times across different environments.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15843037395e6e8e7b2fa0c.png\" alt=\"9 Reviewing Settings and Creating VM\">\r\n\r\nThen you are prompted with a screen where you can check the deployment status. Once succeeded you are provided with a link to directly navigate to the virtual machine resource.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15843037505e6e8e86bb433.png\" alt=\"10 Checking Deployment Status\">\r\n\r\nYou can now view the provisioned VM under the Virtual Machines section.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15843037695e6e8e99a4c74.png\" alt=\"11 Viewing the provisioned VM\">\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information, refer to the below links:\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/azure.microsoft.com\/en-us\/services\/virtual-machines\/\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines<\/a>",

The first screen is to choose an image for the VM or EC2 instance. The image is called an **Amazon machine image** or **AMI**. You can also search for an AMI. Under the image name, you can view the details of the image. Make sure you select the right image. Click on the Select button once decided. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15842969145e6e73d2658a7.png\" alt=\"2 Chossing the Amazon Machine Image or AMI\">\r\n\r\nNext, select the instance type. Here you are selecting the actual compute details i.e. the number of vCPUs and the Memory in GiB. You are billed as per the instance type you select.\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15842969265e6e73dee9670.png\" alt=\"3 Choosing the Instance Type\">\r\n\r\nNext, you select various Instance details. This screen is very vast and makes your deployment very configurable. In this post we will not go into each of these settings. Here you can decide to create an Auto Scaling Group, request spot instances, add placement group, select domain join directory, decide shutdown behavior etc. One key setting that you select here is the **Networking details**. You select your VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) network and the subnet for the instance.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15842971165e6e749cf1a37.png\" alt=\"4_1 Configuring Instance Details\">\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15842971535e6e74c198196.png\" alt=\"4_2 Configuring Instance Details\">\r\n\r\nNext, you configure the Storage details. You can tweak the default storage assigned and can also add more storage. Based on the IOPS requirements you select the Volume type. You can encrypt the storage as well.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15842971705e6e74d26ab0e.png\" alt=\"5 Adding Storage\">\r\n\r\nNext, you add tags to your instance and underlying volumes. **Tags** are a great way to categorize resources. Below is just an example of a couple of tags assigned to the instance and underlying volumes. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15842972035e6e74f3d9532.png\" alt=\"6 Adding Tags\">\r\n\r\nNow you configure the firewall on the Instance via Security Groups. You can create a new one or select an existing one. This is where you decide what can connect to your instance and what can not. In the screenshot below the RDP connectivity on port 3389 is open. Please note that the Source of \"0.0.0.0\/0\" means that it is open for all internet. It is highly recommended that you change this setting to only your IP addresses from where you will connect. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15842972215e6e750563278.png\" alt=\"7 Configuring Security Group\">\r\n\r\nFinally, you review the details. If you need to view the details in detail just expand that category. Click the Edit buttons on the right to edit that setting. Hit Launch to trigger the instance provisioning.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15842972375e6e751597c65.png\" alt=\"8 Review details\">\r\n\r\nBefore the instance can be provisioned, you are prompted with a popup to select a key pair or create a new one. This is a Private and Public key pair that is used to authenticate. You download and keep the Private key. Note that you can only download the Private key at the time of creation. You will not be able to access it later.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15842972555e6e7527c1a67.png\" alt=\"9 Creating or selecting Key Pair to connect to Instance\">\r\n\r\nYou can check the launch status on the next screen. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15842972725e6e75383a905.png\" alt=\"10 Checking Launch Status\">\r\n\r\nFinally, you can view and check your instance. It will be listed in the list under the Instances section under EC2 service.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15842972895e6e7549a0a1c.png\" alt=\"11 Instance in the console\">\r\n\r\nFor more information, refer to the below links:\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/ec2\/\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)<\/a>",

As a good practice, you should add your organization's name or any common internal password to this list with any variants you believe end users may use. The end goal is to try and make the password as much difficult and secure as possible. \r\n\r\nThis feature also allows you to specify the thresholds to lock a user in case of failed sign-in attempts. It allows you to set the time for which the user will be locked out before they can try signing in again. \r\n\r\nThis feature can be accessed by navigating to the Azure Active Directory and then selecting \"Authentication methods\" under the Security section. You will see the \"Password Protection\" option opened up in its own blade. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15542607195ca422ef14a11.jpg\" alt=\"Azure AD Password Protection\">\r\n\r\n**Note**: *Preview customers MUST update the agents to the latest version (1.2.116.0 or higher) immediately. The current agents will stop working after July 1, 2019.*\r\n\r\nFor more information and the announcement blog from Microsoft, read here: <a href=\"https:\/\/techcommunity.microsoft.com\/t5\/Azure-Active-Directory-Identity\/Azure-AD-Password-Protection-is-now-generally-available\/ba-p\/377487\" target=\"_blank\">Azure AD Password Protection is now generally available!<\/a>",

This is a desktop and app virtualization service that runs on the cloud.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Pre-requisites ###\r\n\r\nYou need the following to be able to use this service:\r\n\r\n 1. Azure AD (Active Directory) - If you have an Azure subscription, then you already have this. \r\n 2. Windows Server Active Directory in sync with Azure Active Directory\r\n 3. Azure subscription, containing a virtual network that either contains or is connected to the Windows Server Active Directory - this is where the virtualization will be created and configured\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the Azure VM you create for Windows Virtual Desktop must be:\r\n\r\n 1. Standard domain-joined or Hybrid AD-joined. Virtual machines can't be Azure AD-joined.\r\n 2. Running one of the following supported OS images: Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session or Windows Server 2016\r\n\r\n\r\n### Working with the Service ###\r\n\r\nAt a very high level the steps involve the following:\r\n\r\n 1. Grant Azure Active Directory permissions to the Windows Virtual Desktop Preview service\r\n 2. Assign the TenantCreator application role to a user in your Azure Active Directory tenant\r\n 3. Create a Windows Virtual Desktop Preview tenant\r\n 4.

		"category": "Azure",
		"body": "Navigating Azure Portal can become challenging. You want to navigate to different Azure Resources or Resource Groups or want to check a particular Service in Azure. Instead of going to \"All Services\" and searching for your resource, if you can save a little time by searching more efficiently, it can add up over time and make you more efficient as well. So here are few tips on how you can navigate with ease in Azure.\r\n\r\n### 1. Pin\/Favorite most common Services and re-ordering them ###\r\n\r\nFor a recent project, I was working with Azure Route Table a lot. I was navigating to these multiple times and making a lot of changes. Instead of going to \"All Services\" and searching for Route Table service every time, you search for it only once and Star it to mark it as Favorite. It will start showing up in the Services list to the left under Favorites.  \r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15513414255c779771e2940.png\" alt=\"Marking a Service as Favorite\">\r\n\r\nNext, you want to re-order the Services under Favorites, so you don't have to scroll to navigate to most common services. You can do so by hovering the cursor on the service name under Favorites, and then click and drag on the ellipse (i.e. 3 dots to the right of the service name) as shown below. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15513414435c7797839cd64.png\" alt=\"Re-ordering the service in Favorites\">\r\n\r\nNow you will have the most commonly visited service at the tip of your hands. \r\n\r\n### 2. Pin most common Resources to your dashboard ###\r\n\r\nAnother scenario I faced in one of the projects was that every time I logged in, I had to make some changes to a VM and connect to the same using it's dynamically assigned Public IP. That meant navigating to this VM, every day and starting the VM and connecting to it. I had to start the VM as auto-shutdown was configured on the VM to save cost. Instead of navigating to the Virtual Machines and then searching for the VM and then navigating to it, you can simply Pin the VM to your dashboard. Next time you open the portal, the VM will be right there on the Dashboard. \r\n \r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15513414555c77978fbf2b8.png\" alt=\"Pinning a resource to a dashboard\">\r\n\r\nYou can similarly Pin other resources like SQL Databases, etc.\r\n\r\n### 3. Searching for Resources, Resource Groups, Services and Documentation using the new Search bar ###\r\n\r\nOne of the cool features I stumbled upon is the new search bar in the Azure portal. It had made navigating Azure portal so much easier. You just start searching for the resource or Resource Group or Service name in the text box at the top of the portal. You don't even have to type the whole thing. Just start typing and the results will start popping up. Look for different sections in the suggestions box the pops up under the text box. Click on your desired resource or Resource Group or Service. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15513414665c77979a37437.png\" alt=\"Navigating the smart way\">\r\n\r\nOne advantage of this search box is that you can not just search for resources or resource groups or services, you can also search for Marketplace solutions and Documentation. I have leveraged this feature to search for documentation a lot. You can't remember everything and you have to reference documentation every now and then. Instead of googling the documentation, you can quickly search for it, without leaving the Azure portal and access it. You don't have to worry about navigating away from the Azure portal. The documentation will open up in a separate tab automatically. \r\n\r\nI hope that these tips will help you increase your efficiency. Let us know which tip helped you and which you already knew about, in the comments below. ",

I have had a scenario where after a lot of troubleshooting around Azure Automation, we came to know that the service was experiencing issues in our intended region (US South Central). A quick check from this will rule out the obvious.\r\n 3. Next, you want to check the \"**Activity logs**\". You can check those right from this screen.

If nothing works, you can finally open a **Microsoft Support request** right from this screen. **Note**: If you can't find your issue under common problems, I highly recommend that you search for it in forums like StackOverflow etc. before you open the Microsoft Support request. If it is a business critical issue, then I would recommend that you open the support ticket first and then search for the issue in the interest of time. ",

For former situation, e.g. you have performed a Proof of Concept and now you want to automate the deployment of these set of resources. \r\n\r\nYou want to automate this because you want to deploy these resources multiple times at different times. You want to deploy these in a predictive fashion without any errors due to manual mistakes creeping in. The number of resources can be fairly large and you will actually end up saving time on the creation of these automation templates instead of manually creating everything.\r\n\r\n### Generating Automation for an existing set of resources ###\r\n\r\nTo generate automation for an existing set of resources, either go to the resource group or to any of the resource. Under **Settings** look for the option for \"**Automation script**\". Depending upon number of resources and type of resources, it may take some time to generate the template.\r\n\r\n**Note**: Even though the option says \"Automation script\" it still generates an ARM Template for the automation. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15513440755c77a1cb534d8.png\" alt=\"Automation Template generation for the resources\">\r\n\r\nOnce the template is ready you can do the following:\r\n \r\n 1. You can inspect the template right there on the screen.\r\n 2. You can download the template or directly add it to your library. Once in the library, you can modify it and share it with your team. Or you can directly Deploy it by clicking on the deploy button.\r\n 3. Look out for the errors regarding the resources that can't be exported. E.g. Key vault policies can't be exported by this wizard.\r\n 4. Next, the Template and Parameters are shown. You can also view, Azure CLI, PowerShell, .Net or Ruby code samples to deploy the template.\r\n 5. Make sure that you inspect the template thoroughly. Remove the resources that you don't need. \r\n 6. Also, there will be a lot of hard-coded values in this auto-generated template. It will still be better than starting everything from scratch and doing everything manually. ",

For the latter situation, e.g. automating the deployment of a new set of resources, you will have to start the automation from scratch. Instead of starting from scratch, you can bootstrap your automation via ARM Templates.\r\n\r\n### Reuse Existing ###\r\n\r\nYou can first search for your resources or scenarios in the Microsoft Quick Start templates. Note that these are sample templates from Microsoft and community members. These templates can be found here: <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/Azure\/azure-quickstart-templates\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Quickstart Templates<\/a>. \r\n\r\nWhen you click on a template name you will see multiple files as shown below. Actual template file will always be named as \"***azuredeploy.json***\". The related parameters file will be named as \"***azuredeploy.parameters.json***\". All other files are optional and are the supporting files for the template.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15513749945c781a929e78b.png\" alt=\"Sample Template in Quickstart Repo on GitHub\">\r\n\r\nYou can download these files and edit them. You can fork them directly in GitHub and start editing in a source control environment, but your changes will be public (unless you change your repository to Private). If you do not want to make changes and want to directly deploy one of the template, simply click on the \"**Deploy to Azure**\" button. This will open Azure portal and you will need to sign into your subscription. Then the template deployment blade will open with the template information already populated. You will just need to select right Subscription, Resource Group and provide various parameters. \r\n\r\nIt is really simple and saves you lot of time instead of authoring the template from scratch. Why re-invent the wheel. Reuse instead!\r\n\r\n### Generating template for new resource creation in Azure ###\r\n\r\nIf you are creating new resource from the Azure portal and you have to perform this same action multiple times, you should consider using an ARM Template. If you want to create an ARM Template for a resource for which you can't find a template, even then you can use Azure portal to bootstrap the template creation, rather than starting from scratch. \r\n\r\nSimple go ahead and start creating your resource from Azure portal. At the last screen, instead of actually creating the resource, look for a link with the name as \"**Download a template for automation**\". This will open another blade which will show you the template. You can download the template from here. It will also include the related parameters file and a script to perform the deployment of your template. The below screenshot shows you the option for Storage Account creation.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15513748915c781a2b8fa9a.png\" alt=\"Option for Download a template for automation\">\r\n\r\n**Note**: This option will not be available for all resource types. Microsoft is adding this option to more and more resources everyday. ",

Once your testing is complete, then you can simply reassociate the subnets back to the original Route Tables. \r\n\r\n**Note**: Use these scripts with caution as these will affect the networking and communication between resources. Go through the scripts and ensure that you know what the scripts are doing before executing these in your environment. Also, always test these in a dev environment before running in any other environment. \r\n\r\n### Script samples and how they work ###\r\n\r\nThe scripts in this sample are:\r\n\r\n 1. **Disassociate-SubnetsFromUDRs.ps1** - This script disassociates the subnets from the Route Tables\r\n 2. **Associate-SubnetsToUDRs.ps1** - This script reassociates the subnets back to the Route Tables. This uses a CSV file as an input. A sample of the CSV file is also provided along with the script. \r\n\r\nThe **disassociation script** fetches the Route Tables and then gets the associated Subnet details from there. It then removes the association by setting the route table property on the subnet to ***$null*** as shown below:\r\n\r\n    Set-AzureRmVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig `\r\n    -Name $subnetName `\r\n    -VirtualNetwork $virtualNetwork `\r\n    -AddressPrefix $subnetAddressPrefix `\r\n    -RouteTable $null |\r\n    Set-AzureRmVirtualNetwork\r\n\r\nThe **association script** works in an exactly opposite way. The major difference is that this script fetches the information from a CSV file as provided along with the sample. This can also be autogenerated (prior to disassociation). The script sample for generating this CSV can be found here: <a href=\"https:\/\/HarvestingClouds.com\/post\/script-sample-generate-report-for-route-tables-with-associated-subnets-and-related-information\/\" target=\"_blank\">Generate Report for Route Tables with associated Subnets and related information<\/a>\r\n\r\nThe command for creating the association of Subnet to the Route Table looks like below. \r\n\r\n\r\n    Set-AzureRmVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig `\r\n    -Name $subnetName `\r\n    -VirtualNetwork $virtualNetwork `\r\n    -AddressPrefix $subnetAddressPrefix `\r\n    -RouteTable $routeTable |\r\n    Set-AzureRmVirtualNetwork \r\n\r\n\r\n### Location of the Scripts ###\r\n\r\nYou can find this script in GitHub at this location: <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/HarvestingClouds\/PowerShellSamples\/tree\/master\/Scripts\/User%20Defined%20Routes%20(UDRs)%20or%20Route%20Tables%20Related%20Scripts\" target=\"_blank\">User Defined Routes (UDRs) or Route Tables Related Scripts<\/a>\r\n",

Any action that can corrupt the VM or its configurations should be preceded by exporting of VM's configurations.

If you do not specify this then nested properties may not export properly. Specifying a large enough depth ensures that all nested properties are also exported. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe script encapsulates all this logic into a reusable function.

Refer the official documentation here: <a href=\"https:\/\/azure.microsoft.com\/en-ca\/pricing\/hybrid-benefit\/\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Hybrid Benefit<\/a>\r\n\r\n\r\n### Script Requirements ###\r\n\r\nThe script requires you to populate the configurations CSV file. The sample CSV file is also provided along with the script. This configurations file should have the following columns:\r\n\r\n 1. Computer - Name of the VM in Azure\r\n 2. OSType - Windows or Linux\r\n 3. ResourceGroupName - Resource Group of the VM\r\n 4. HUBLicensingNeeded - yes or no. The HUB Licensing is set for only the VMs for which this value is set to yes.\r\n\r\n### Script Working ###\r\n\r\nIn its entirety, the HUB licensing is just a switch for \"**LicenseType**\" on the VM. For Windows servers, if it's value is set to \"**Windows_Server**\" then this means that you own a Windows Server license and are claiming the HUB Licensing benefits on this VM. \r\n\r\nThe script applied the HUB licensing in 3 steps. First, it fetches the VM.\r\n\r\n    $currentVm = Get-AzureRmVM -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -Name $virtualMachineName -ErrorAction Stop\r\n\r\nThen it applies the HUB licensing as shown below.\r\n\r\n    $currentVm.LicenseType = \"Windows_Server\"\r\n\r\nLastly, it updates the VM object.\r\n\r\n    Update-AzureRmVM -VM $currentVm -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName\r\n\r\n**Note**: As a best practice, the script also checks whether the HUB Licensing is already applied or not. If the HUB licensing is already there on the VM then the Script does applies it again. There may be small downtime when the VM is updating and therefore a short downtime should be planned when doing this operation. \r\n\r\nThe script encapsulates all this logic into a reusable function.

You will want to change the size of the VMs periodically after thoroughly reviewing the consumption.

The sample CSV file is also provided along with the script. This configurations file should have the following columns:\r\n\r\n 1. Computer - Name of the VM in Azure\r\n 2. OSType - Windows or Linux\r\n 3. ResourceGroupName - Resource Group of the VM\r\n 4. SizeConversionNeeded - yes or no\r\n 5. NewVMComputeSize - new size of the VM. e.g. Standard_DS4_v2. This should conform to the VM size names. For Windows VMs these names can be found by navigating to one of the sizes related link here: <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/virtual-machines\/windows\/sizes\" target=\"_blank\">Sizes for Windows virtual machines in Azure<\/a>\r\n\r\n\r\n### Script Working ###\r\n\r\nThe script works in 3 simple steps. In the first step the script fetches the Azure VM using Get-AzureRmVM cmdlet and ensures that it exists. \r\n\r\n    $currentVm = Get-AzureRmVM -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -Name $virtualMachineName -ErrorAction Stop\r\n\r\nThe second step is to update the size property for the Hardware profile of the vm object.\r\n\r\n    $currentVm.HardwareProfile.VmSize = $vmSize \r\n\r\nLastly, the script updates the VM using the below command.\r\n\r\n    Update-AzureRmVM -VM $currentVm -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName\r\n\r\n**Note** that there will be a restart on the VM during the size conversion. Do plan for an outage although very minimal. Do keep some buffer in the outage window to account for any unforeseen issues that may occur during the conversion. I have converted various VMs and have never encountered any issues. Still, when I plan for an outage, as a best practice I do plan for a larger window. \r\n\r\nThe script encapsulates all this logic into a reusable function.

Set this to yes for the VMs for which you want to perform the conversion from older disk type to Managed Disk VMs\r\n\r\n\r\n### Script Working ###\r\n\r\nThe process of Managed Disk conversion is different for a VM with Availability Set and one without it. For this reason the script first checks for the Availability Set of the VM.\r\n\r\n    $avSet = Get-AzureRmAvailabilitySet -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Name $asName -ErrorAction Stop\r\n\r\nIt then checks and sets the **Managed** flag on the Availability Set by using the following command.\r\n\r\n    Update-AzureRmAvailabilitySet -AvailabilitySet $avSet -Managed -ErrorAction Stop\r\n\r\nIt then stops the VM, converts it to Managed Disk Vm and then waits for 600 seconds. The conversion is performed by following command.\r\n\r\n    ConvertTo-AzureRmVMManagedDisk -ResourceGroupName $rgName -VMName $vm.Name\r\n\r\n**Note**: The script does not start the VM to avoid unnecessary costs.

Simply provide the inputs and you can provide access to the users at any scope i.e. Subscriptions, Resource Group or individual resource. \r\n\r\nCurrently, the script factors in Virtual Machines as individual resources, but these can be replaced by any resource type. \r\n\r\n### Inputs and Script Requirements ###\r\n\r\nThe script takes in the following inputs:\r\n\r\n 1. csvLocation - this is the CSV containing the name of the resources on which you want to provide the role-based access. An example CSV is also provided with the script. It is simply two column CSV. The first column being the VM Name (or resource name if you want to generalize) and the second column is the Resource Group containing that resource.\r\n 2. role - This is the role that you want to assign. E.g. \"Virtual Machine Operator\"\r\n 3. Scope - this can be one of the 3 values viz. \"VirtualMachine\", \"Subscription\" or \"ResourceGroup\"\r\n 4. Usernames - this can be an array of the user names who will be assigned the access on the resources\r\n 5. Groupnames - if groups need to be assigned access then they can be mentioned here\r\n 6. RBACOperatorFlag - a boolean value with the default value of true. You set this to false when you are making changes and do not want the script to perform any actions. You do not need to worry about this parameter for most scenarios and can ignore this. \r\n\r\n### Example Execution ###\r\n\r\nExample execution of the script will look like below. \r\n\r\n    Apply-RBACRoleToResources -csvLocation \"C:\\Users\\aman\\Documents\\AzureVM.csv\" -role \"Virtual Machine Operator\" -Scope \"VirtualMachine\" -UserNames \"user1,user2\" -GroupNames \"abac\" \r\n\r\nThe above command will read the VM names and their related REsource Groups form the AzureVM.csv file. This will assign \"Virtual machine operator\" role at the Virtual Macine level. This role will be assigned to the user1 and user2 users along with abac Group name. \r\n\r\n### Location of the Script ###\r\n\r\nYou can find this script in GitHub at this location: <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/HarvestingClouds\/PowerShellSamples\/tree\/master\/Scripts\/Apply-RBACRoleToResources\" target=\"_blank\">Apply-RBACRoleToResources.ps1<\/a>\r\n",

Ping check using the ***Test-Connection*** cmdlet\r\n 2. PS Remoting checking by trying to open a PS Session using ***New-PSSession*** cmdlet\r\n 3. The script also tries to connect to the WMI and list various object using ***Get-Wmiobject*** cmdlet\r\n 4. Similar to the PS Remoting check it also checks for WS Man by using the ***Test-WSMan*** cmdlet\r\n\r\nIt can then fetch VM related information by either remoting into it or by using WMI.

Its data type is Object when coming from ASR Recovery Plan.\r\n\r\n    {\r\n       \"RecoveryPlanName\":\"RecoveryPlan-Test\",\r\n       \"FailoverType\":\"Test\",\r\n       \"FailoverDirection\":\"PrimaryToSecondary\",\r\n       \"GroupId\":\"Group1\",\r\n       \"VmMap\":{\r\n          \"aaaaaa-1111-1111-1111-aaaaaaaaaaa\":{\r\n             \"SubscriptionId\":\"bbbbbbbb-2222-2222-2222-bbbbbbbbbbb\",\r\n             \"ResourceGroupName\":\"rg-dr-test-asr\",\r\n             \"CloudServiceName\":null,\r\n             \"RoleName\":\"VMName-test\",\r\n             \"RecoveryPointId\":\"cccccccccc-3333-3333-3333-cccccccccccc\",\r\n             \"RecoveryPointTime\":\"\\\/Date(1550773609103)\\\/\"\r\n          }\r\n       }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n### How does this Script work ###\r\n\r\nThe script first uses \"***ConvertFrom-Json***\" cmdlet to parses the object to valid PowerShell object. It then uses the VMMap property of the Recovery Plan Context object to get various pieces of the information. \r\n\r\nThe script also uses a ***foreach*** look to factor for multiple Vms in the Recovery Plan.

The input parameter to this Runbook will be a **Recovery Plan Context**, that will automatically be passed by the ASR Recovery Plan. This Recovery plan context will contain information like: \r\n\r\n 1. Recovery Plan Name\r\n 2. Failover Type\r\n 3. Failover DIrection\r\n 4. Subscription Name\r\n 5. Resource Group Name\r\n 6.

E.g. If the automation that you want to trigger on Failover, requires connection to the company's internal network, then you would want it to run on a Hybrid worker (which will be connected to your internal network). As such, I recommend that the parsing of the recovery plan context should be done in another Runbook, which should be invoked by the main Runbook. \r\n\r\nThis sample PowerShell Runbook accepts the Recovery Plan context and passes it to the second Runbook. That Runbook may or may not run on a Hybrid worker. \r\n\r\n### Sample Recovery Plan Context ###\r\n\r\nA sample Recovery Plan Context looks like below.

As such you will need to pull lots of reports based on this consumption and usage related csv file that you get from the EA portal i.e. at address: <a href=\"https:\/\/ea.azure.com\" target=\"_blank\">https:\/\/ea.azure.com<\/a>. Tagging is one of the important components. But it comes as a composite JSON in one column. You will want to split this into multiple columns, with one column for each tag. \r\n\r\nThe script sample in this blog performs exactly this parsing for you. You will need to tweak the script to include the tags as per your environment. \r\n\r\n> **Note**: The EA portal is only available to the EA customer. If you are not an EA customer, then if you try to login, you will get the following error:Invalid User: The account provided is not a valid user of the Microsoft Azure Enterprise Portal. Please sign in with a valid account. If you believe you have received this message in error, please contact Support.\r\n\r\n### Sample Input EA Azure Billing CSV ###\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tags section in the CSV will look similar to below **JSON format key-value pairs** under the column for \"**Tags**\":\r\n\r\n    {  \"ApplicationOwner\": \"aman@domain.com\",  \"BusinessUnit\": \"Infrastructure\",  \"ApplicationType\": \"Test\",  \"Department\": \"Infrastructure\"}\r\n\r\nNow as a requirement, you will want to split this to separate columns for the Tags for \"Application Owner\", \"Business Unit\", \"ApplicationType\" and \"Department\". \r\n\r\n### How does the script parse this JSON ###\r\n\r\nThe script parses the JSON by splitting it into multiple values and then saving the new object as an output CSV. Right now these tag values are hard coded into the script and needs to be tweaked as per your requirements. Look out for the names of the variables and output member names with same name as that of the Tags mentioned above. These are the ones that you will need to alter. \r\n\r\nThe script also takes into factor if the tag was added incorrectly with space in the name instead of pascal casing (i.e. name with no space between two words and first letter capital for each word).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Location of the Script ###\r\n\r\nThe script is located in the GitHub along with samples for Input and Output CSV files at this location: <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/HarvestingClouds\/PowerShellSamples\/tree\/master\/Scripts\/Format-EABillingUsageCsvForTags\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub location for Format Billing CSV Script<\/a>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> **Note**: An alternative to using the billing related csv file is to leverage **PowerBI** and build dashboards by consuming the EA related billing APIs which are available out of the box. These are in preview at the time of the writing of this blog. Parsing tags is still an issue with these. We will cover these in one of the future blog post. ",

The steps to enable are:\r\n\r\n - Login to your VM via Remote Desktop\r\n - From an Administrative command prompt run the following commands \r\n\r\n     `bcdedit \/ems {current} on`\r\n    \r\n `bcdedit \/emssettings EMSPORT:1 EMSBAUDRATE:115200`\r\n\r\n- Reboot the system for the SAC console to be enabled\r\n\r\n### How to Access ###\r\n\r\nCurrently, this option (in Preview at the time of writing this blog) is available only via the portal. To access the Serial Console go to:\r\n\r\n 1. The Virtual Machine (VM) for which you want to access the Serial Console\r\n 2. Ensure that the VM is up and running\r\n 3. Navigate to the  \"**Serial console (Preview)**\" option under \"Support + Troubleshooting\" section in VM settings\r\n\r\nIf the VM is not up and running then you will view the below error.\r\n\r\n    The serial console connection to the VM encountered an error: 'Bad Request'\r\n     (400) - The VM is in a stopped deallocated state.  Please start the VM and retry the serial console connection.\r\n\r\nWhen the VM is starting you will see the below message, which you are connected to the Serial Console.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15222511335abbb57d69110.png\" alt=\"Connecting to SAC\">\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce connected you can run commands like `ch -?` for information on using channels and simply type `?` for general help.\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15222511405abbb5841a716.png\" alt=\"Connected SAC and Help options\">\r\n\r\n**Note**: The console automatically will disconnect after a period of inactivity.\r\n\r\nThe access is being opened to more and more subscriptions and regions.

E.g. your database contains information regarding the Credit Cards of your customers. When exposing the database you want to ensure that the credit cards are not exposed. They should automatically be presented in the format \"xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-1234\" i.e. only exposing the last 4 digits. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Feature Basics ###\r\n\r\nThis feature can be accessed by navigating to your database and then clicking on the \"**Dynamic Data Masking**\" option under settings. By default, there are no masks applied. Click on \"**+ Add mask**\" to add a new mask.\r\n\r\n**Note** that whatever masks you apply are not applied to the administrators. Additionally, you can provide the SQL users who should be excluded from masking. \r\n\r\nAzure SQL Database will also automatically try to recommend the fields that should be masked.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15224833815abf40b536b22.png\" alt=\"Navigating to the Dynamic Data Masking Option\">\r\n\r\n### Adding Masking Rules ###\r\n\r\nWhen adding Masking Rules you provide below information:\r\n\r\n 1. Name for the mask is auto-populated (based on your selections)\r\n 2. Schema\r\n 3. Table in that schema\r\n 4. Column in the table, where mask should be applied\r\n 5. Masking Criteria\r\n\r\n**Note** that the Masking criteria vary based on the type of the column. E.g. If a column does not have numerical value then the masking criteria for \"Number (random number range)\" will show as disabled.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15224833865abf40bad27e8.png\" alt=\"Adding Masking Rule\">\r\n\r\nThe different masking criteria that you can apply are:\r\n\r\n 1. Default value  (0, xxxx, 01-01-1900)\r\n 2. Credit Card value (xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-1234)\r\n 3. Email (aXXX@XXXX.com)\r\n 4. Number (random number range)\r\n 5. Custom string (prefix [padding] suffix)",

The firewall rules are always set at the server level, hence any rule you put will allow access on all the databases on the SQL Server.\r\n\r\nSetting up the Rules is very simple. You navigate to the firewall settings for the SQL Database\/SQL Server (as discussed in the previous blog). Then you focus on the lower section on the blade for Virtual Network Firewall rules as shown below.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15225265255abfe93da6c61.png\" alt=\"Virtual Network Firewall Rules section\">\r\n\r\nNote that you can:\r\n\r\n 1. Add existing virtual network\r\n 2. Create a new virtual network (and provide access)\r\n\r\nAs a best practice, you should plan the virtual network and subnets before the configurations on the SQL Server Firewall. \r\n\r\nWhen you click on \"Add existing virtual network\" you are presented with the below wizard. Here you select:\r\n\r\n 1. The name for the rule. This could be any descriptive name for the rule.\r\n 2. The Subscription where the virtual network exists\r\n 3. Virtual network where you want to allow the access\r\n 4.

This layer is provided by the SQL Server **Firewall**. Azure provides you granular control to configure this firewall and to manage who gets access to your Azure SQL Database. By default, everything is blocked by the firewall. If you want to get access to Azure SQL Database then you will have to configure the Firewall at the SQL Server level. Only the IP addresses you configure have access to the SQL Databases on the Server.\r\n\r\nAnother key point to understand is that once you configure a rule then because that rule is applied at the server level, it is applied to all the SQL Databases on that Server. So it is important to ensure that you segregate your databases on different SQL Servers if you don't want to share the access to those databases.\r\n\r\n### Accessing the Firewall Settings ###\r\n\r\nYou can access the firewall settings by navigating to your Azure SQL **Database**. Then at the top of the blade, you will find the option for \"**Set server firewall**\". Click on this button to access the firewall settings.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15224826395abf3dcf84ca9.png\" alt=\"Set Server Firewall option on Azure SQL Database\">\r\n\r\nAnother way to access the settings is on Azure SQL **Servers**. Navigate to the related Azure SQL Server for your database. Under the settings, find the option for \"**Firewalls and virtual networks**\". Clicking on this will also take you to the same firewall settings as the settings are set at the server level in both ways.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15224826455abf3dd50a424.png\" alt=\"Firewall option on Azure SQL Server\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### Firewall Rule Settings ###\r\n\r\nLet us look at the firewall rule settings in more details. \r\n\r\n 1. First, you have the option to enable or disable the **access to Azure services** as the toggle for \"Allow access to Azure services\". This is set to On by default when creating the Database and SQL server. You can disable it here. This option allows Azure services to provide monitoring data and recommend changes at the database level.\r\n 2. Second, you have the option to **configure a Rule**. This is where you configure which IP Addresses have access to the SQL Server.\r\n 3. One commonly used Rule is to open the access for **Client IP**. This is the IP address of the machine from where you are connected to the Azure Portal. This is provided for the common scenario where you want to connect and access the SQL database via SSMS (i.e. SQL Server Management Studio) or by any other way from your development box. There is a button to simply add the rule for allowing Client IP by clicking on \"**+Add client IP**\". The client IP is also authomatically displayed under the \"Allow access to Azure services\" section\r\n 4. Lastly, there is an option to allow access to the SQL databases from a particular Subnet in a Virtual Network in Azure, without having to manually configure their IP addresses. This feature requires **Service Endpoints** to be configured at the Virtual Network level. We will discuss this feature in a later blog. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15224826505abf3ddaaf183.png\" alt=\"Firewall Settings\">\r\n\r\nA typical Rule contains:\r\n\r\n 1. A **Rule Name** - which could be any descriptive name for the rule. E.g. it could be name of the single VM for which you want to configure the access or it could be name of the network for which you are opening the access\r\n 2. **Start IP** - Start of the IP address range for which you want to open the access. E.g. if you want to open access for 10.20.1.0\/24 then the Start IP will be 10.20.1.0\r\n 3. **End IP** - End of the IP address range for which you want to open the access. E.g. if you want to open access for 10.20.1.0\/24 then the End IP will be 10.20.1.255\r\n\r\nNote: If you want to provide access to only one IP address then provide that IP address for both Start and End IP fields.\r\n\r\nNote in the image below that:\r\n\r\n 1. The client IP rule was added by clicking on the \"+Client IP\" button. Note that the Start and End IP are same for this rule\r\n 2. Second is a custom rule which allows access to the SQL Server from a specific VM hosting Website (which will need access to the database)\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15224826565abf3de09ea3f.png\" alt=\"Setting Firewall Rules\">\r\n\r\nOnce you are done configuring, just hit Save to apply the firewall rules.\r\n\r\nNext, we will learn about setting up the <a href=\"https:\/\/HarvestingClouds.com\/post\/demystifying-azure-security-azure-sql-database-firewall-rule-for-virtual-networks\/\" target=\"_blank\">Firewall Rule for Virtual Networks<\/a> and also <a href=\"https:\/\/HarvestingClouds.com\/post\/demystifying-azure-security-azure-sql-database-and-azure-storage-service-endpoints-on-virtual-network\/\" target=\"_blank\">Service Endpoints for Azure SQL on Virtual Network<\/a>",

Recently the language had a complete overhaul with new syntax coming in and various new features being incorporated into the new language. This blog post talks about the resources to quickly learn the new syntax. Specifically, if you know the older syntax or you know T-SQL syntax then how to translate that knowledge. \r\n\r\n### Older to new Query Language syntax ###\r\n\r\nIf you have been working with the older Log Analytics query syntax, then you have two options to convert that knowledge to newer query language syntax:\r\n\r\n 1. Use the in portal legacy syntax converter and learn as you convert\r\n 2. Use the Microsoft provided Cheat Sheet\r\n\r\nWhen you navigate to OMS log analytics portal and go to the Log search section, there you will see a link above the query text window for \"**Show legacy language converter**\". When you click on this link a new text box will appear above the query text box. Type your legacy query and then click on \"**Convert**\" button. The query will be converted into the new language syntax. Click Run to execute the query. If there will be any errors in the query you will be notified of the same. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15212342425aac314289ed9.png\" alt=\"OMS Language Converter\">\r\n\r\nIn the above example, \"Event\" type is being fetched and then only Source, EventLog, EventID properties are selected. In the older format the query syntax used to be:\r\n\r\n    Type=Event | select Source, EventLog, EventID\r\n\r\nIn the newer format the same query looks as below:\r\n\r\n    Event | project Source, EventLog, EventID\r\n\r\nPointers for key query syntax can be found in the complete cheat sheet which can be found here: <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.loganalytics.io\/docs\/Learn\/References\/Legacy-to-new-to-Azure-Log-Analytics-Language\" target=\"_blank\">Legacy to new Azure Log Analytics Query Language cheat sheet<\/a>\r\n\r\n### T-SQL to new Query Language syntax ###\r\n\r\nIf you are well versed in the T-SQL query syntax and are new to OMS Azure Log Analytics, then you can easily translate that to the Log Analytics query language with the help of the cheat sheet provided by Microsoft for the key syntax.\r\n\r\nE.g. if we want to select records for only columns name and resultCode from a table named dependencies then the query syntax in T-SQL will look like:\r\n\r\n    SELECT name, resultCode FROM dependencies\r\n\r\nSyntax for the same query in newer Log Analytics language will look like:\r\n\r\n    dependencies \r\n    | project name, resultCode\r\n\r\nAs you might have guessed already, \"project\" is a key word in newer language to select specific columns. Selecting a table is as simple as typing the name of the table.\r\n\r\nThe complete cheat sheet can be found here: <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.loganalytics.io\/docs\/Learn\/References\/SQL-to-Azure-Log-Analytics\" target=\"_blank\">SQL to Azure Log Analytics query language cheat sheet<\/a>",

If configured it encrypts your database, backups of the database and transactional log files at rest. Normally this is configured by default to provide you with an additional layer of security. If this is not configured then you will get a recommendation to configure it in the Azure Security Center. \r\n\r\nTuring Off Transparent data encryption will result in decryption of the complete database and will leave your data vulnerable. When you turn it back On then the database will be encrypted again. Depending upon the size of your database, it may take some time to turn the TDE on or off due to the underlying encryption\/decryption process.\r\n\r\nThis service does not require any changes at the application level. Behind the scene, transparent data encryption performs real-time I\/O encryption and decryption of the data at the page level. Each page is decrypted when it's read into memory and then encrypted before being written to disk.\r\n\r\n**Note**: Even if the database is encrypted with TDE, when you take an export of the database (e.g. creation of BACPAK file) then the backup file is created without encryption. You need to ensure that you safeguard\/encrypt the backup files before sharing these on an open network.\r\n\r\n### Configuring TDE at the Database level ###\r\n\r\n**Transparent Data Encryption** (**TDE**) can be enabled or disabled at every individual Database level. The configuration is a very simple toggle between on and off. To configure this, navigate to your Azure SQL Database. In the settings, select \"Transparent Data Encryption\". The set the value for \"Data Encryption\" On or Off. \r\n\r\nNotice the Encryption status. If you want your data to be encrypted, then the encryption status should say \"Encrypted\" with a green tick mark. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15221022915ab9701353492.png\" alt=\"Configuring Transparent Data Encryption\">\r\n\r\n### Configuring to use your own Key with TDE ###\r\n\r\nYou can **use your own Key for encryption** with Transparent Data Encryption. If you do not configure to use your own key, then a service managed certificate is used for encryption and decryption.\r\n\r\nTo do this you will need to upload your key to an Azure Key Vault or generate a new key within the Key Vault, which is very easy to configure. Once you have a key in an Azure Key Vault, you will be able to use the same with Transparent Data Encryption (TDE). \r\n\r\nThis setting can't be configured at a Database level. Instead, this has to be configured at the server level. Navigate to the underlying Azure SQL Server (where the SQL Database is hosted). Then follow the below steps:\r\n\r\n 1. In the settings, click on the Transparent Data Encryption\r\n 2. Select \"Yes\" to Use your own key. \r\n 3. Then click on \"Select a Key\" and then select the key from your Azure Key Vault. Alternatively, you can select to \"Enter Key Identifier\". \r\n 4. Once the key is configured, select \"Save\" to save the settings.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15221022965ab9701842974.png\" alt=\"Using own Key for encryption with Transparent Data Encryption\">\r\n\r\nThis option provides you with all the security at the data level (at rest) while ensuring you have complete control over the process.\r\n",

All posts in the series can be found here: <a href=\"https:\/\/HarvestingClouds.com\/post\/demystifying-azure-security-series-index\/\" target=\"_blank\">Demystifying Azure Security - Series Index<\/a>\r\n\r\n**Auditing & Threat Detection** in Azure SQL Database is a very simple to configure yet very powerful security feature. **Auditing** feature audits all activity on your database to a Storage Account. You can determine the number of days for which you want to retain the data. It helps you remain compliant. In an event of any failure or compliance breach, you can go to the audit logs and can pinpoint the exact cause of the issue if this feature is enabled. \r\n\r\n**Threat Detection** is an advanced feature, where Microsoft runs various algorithms under the hood and determines the pattern and identifies any potential attacks on your data. E.g. SQL Injection or patterns like SQL Injection can be detected when this feature is enabled. Please note that the Threat Detection feature has additional cost linked to it. It costs $15\/server\/month. It will be free for the first 60 days. Note that you can enable Auditing without enabling Threat Detection. But you can't enable Threat Detection without enabling Auditing on the data first. \r\n\r\nSQL Threat Detection integrates alerts with Azure Security Center. If any anomalous activity is detected an alert is raised, you can get notification via email and can also review the same within the portal. You get real-time actionable alerts. Each alert also contains the information regarding how to mitigate the alert.\r\n\r\n### Configurations ###\r\n\r\nTo configure Auditing and Threat Detection at the database level, navigate to the database. Then follow the below steps:\r\n\r\n 1. In the database settings, click on \"Auditing and Threat Detection\"\r\n 2. You can optionally configure the settings at the Server level by click on the link \"View server settings\"\r\n 3. Next, toggle the \"Auditing\" setting on or off. Select the storage account and retention in the number of days. \r\n 4. Next, you can configure the \"Threat Detection\" on or off. If you toggle it on, then you have the option of selecting which type of Threats you want to detect.\r\n 5. You also have the option of configuring Email notifications which work with the Threat Detection.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15220454795ab89227d4b60.png\" alt=\"Auditing and Threat Detection Configuration\">\r\n\r\nWhen configuring Audit Logs Storage, you can select any subscription under the tenant and a storage account in that subscription. You can then select Retention in number of Days. When this number is set to Zero then that means unlimited retention. You can select a maximum of 3285 number of days for this value. You can also select whether to use a Primary or Secondary key while accessing the Storage Account for writing the logs.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15220454845ab8922cbf5d7.png\" alt=\"Audit Logs Storage Configurations\">\r\n\r\nUnder Threat Detection types, you can select any one or all of the following types:\r\n\r\n 1. SQL injection\r\n 2. SQL injection vulnerability\r\n 3. Anomalous client login\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15220454895ab8923166b5d.png\" alt=\"Threat Detection Types\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Enabling at Database level vs Server level ###\r\n\r\nIf Blob Auditing or Threat Detection are enabled on the server, they will always apply to the database, regardless of the database settings.\r\n\r\nAt the server level, the configuration is almost identical. You need to navigate to the related Azure SQL Server first (instead of the SQL Database). Notice at the top of the below screenshot, it says \"SQL server\" instead of \"SQL database\". Then navigate to it's \"Auditing and Threat Detection\" section and perform the configurations similar to above sections. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15220454945ab8923632728.png\" alt=\"Audit and Threat Detection at the server level\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

All posts in the series can be found here: <a href=\"https:\/\/HarvestingClouds.com\/post\/demystifying-azure-security-series-index\/\" target=\"_blank\">Demystifying Azure Security - Series Index<\/a>\r\n\r\nBefore going through this blog, please ensure that you have visited the basics of RBAC Roles in general, explained in a primer here: <a href=\"https:\/\/HarvestingClouds.com\/post\/demystifying-azure-security-rbac-roles\/\" target=\"_blank\">Demystifying Azure Security - RBAC Roles<\/a>.\r\n\r\nThis blog explains an easy approach to understand and create your own Custom RBAC Roles in Azure (ARM model). We will inspect an existing simple role and will reverse engineer the way to create Custom RBAC Roles. \r\n\r\n### Inspecting Existing Role's Definition ###\r\n\r\nStart by inspecting any existing Role's Definition. To do this run the cmdlet **Get-AzureRMRoleDefinition** and provide the name of any built-in RBAC Role. For this blog, run the below script to inspect the \"Reader\" and \"Virtual Machine Contributor\" roles.\r\n\r\n    Login-AzureRMAccount\r\n    \r\n    Get-AzureRMRoleDefinition -Name \"Reader\" | ConvertTo-Json | Out-File C:\\rbacrole-reader.json\r\n\r\n    Get-AzureRMRoleDefinition -Name \"Virtual Machine Contributor\" | ConvertTo-Json | Out-File C:\\rbacrole-VMContributor.json\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you open and inspect the \"rbacrole-reader.json\" file you will see the JSON similar to below:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n        \"Name\":  \"Reader\",\r\n        \"Id\":  \"aaaa11a1-3333-48ef-bd42-f606fba81ae7\",\r\n        \"IsCustom\":  false,\r\n        \"Description\":  \"Lets you view everything, but not make any changes.\",\r\n        \"Actions\":  [\r\n                        \"*\/read\"\r\n                    ],\r\n        \"NotActions\":  [\r\n    \r\n                       ],\r\n        \"AssignableScopes\":  [\r\n                                 \"\/\"\r\n                             ]\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNotice above that there are below sections in the definition:\r\n\r\n 1. **Name** - Name of the role\r\n 2. **Id** - unique guid for the role\r\n 3. **IsCustom** - boolean value. \"true\" for the Custom Roles and \"false\" for the built-in roles\r\n 4. **Description** - description of the role\r\n 5. **Actions** - Allowed list of actions for the Role\r\n 6. **NotActions** - Not Allowed list of actions for the Role\r\n 7. **AssignableScopes** - Scope at which this role can be assigned. E.g. all the subscription Ids. It's mandatory that the RBAC role contains the explicit subscription IDs where it is used otherwise you will not be able to use the role.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Understanding Actions and NotActions ###\r\n\r\nAs mentioned before, Actions describe the allowed list of action for the Role whereas the NotActions describe the not allowed actions for the Role. You can use wildcard * and special syntax to define the Actions and NotActions, as per the Microsoft documentation here: <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/active-directory\/role-based-access-control-custom-roles\" target=\"_blank\">Create custom roles for Azure Role-Based Access Control<\/a>:\r\n\r\nOperation strings that contain wildcards (\\*) grant access to all operations that match the operation string. For instance:\r\n\r\n* `*\/read` grants access to read operations for all resource types of all Azure resource providers.\r\n* `Microsoft.Compute\/*` grants access to all operations for all resource types in the Microsoft.Compute resource provider.\r\n* `Microsoft.Network\/*\/read` grants access to read operations for all resource types in the Microsoft.Network resource provider of Azure.\r\n* `Microsoft.Compute\/virtualMachines\/*` grants access to all operations of virtual machines and its child resource types.\r\n* `Microsoft.Web\/sites\/restart\/Action` grants access to restart websites.\r\n\r\nUse `Get-AzureRmProviderOperation` (in PowerShell) or `azure provider operations show` (in Azure CLI) to list operations of Azure resource providers. You may also use these commands to verify that an operation string is valid and to expand wildcard operation strings.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Get-AzureRMProviderOperation Microsoft.Compute\/virtualMachines\/*\/action | FT Operation, OperationName\r\n    \r\n    Get-AzureRMProviderOperation Microsoft.Network\/*\r\n\r\n### Defining a Custom role ###\r\n\r\nLet's define a custom role, who can start or restart a VM in Azure but can't open a support ticket.\r\n\r\nSave the following code as \"yourCustomRole01.json\" file on your C drive (or any other location).\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      \"Name\": \"Virtual Machine Start and Restart\",\r\n      \"Id\": \"7ed03a9f-b372-4341-ba8d-38ef8e614038\",\r\n      \"IsCustom\": true,\r\n      \"Description\": \"Can restart virtual machines but can't open support tickets.\",\r\n      \"Actions\": [\r\n        \"Microsoft.Compute\/virtualMachines\/start\/action\",\r\n        \"Microsoft.Compute\/virtualMachines\/restart\/action\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"NotActions\": [\r\n        \"Microsoft.Support\/*\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"AssignableScopes\": [\r\n        \"\/subscriptions\/aaaaaaaa-1111-1111-1111-111111111111\",\r\n        \"\/subscriptions\/aaaaaaaa-2222-2222-2222-222222222222\",\r\n        \"\/subscriptions\/aaaaaaaa-3333-3333-3333-333333333333\/resourceGroups\/RG-Prod-USE2\"\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNotice the Action and NotAction area are set as per the requirements.\r\n\r\nAlso, note that under Assignable Scope the role is available for assignment to all Resources and Resource Groups in the first two subscriptions but only in Resource Group named \"RG-Prod-USE2\" for the third subscription in the list.\r\n\r\n### Creating New Custom role ###\r\n\r\nOnce you have the definition ready in a JSON file, you can use the \"**New-AzureRMRoleDefinition**\" cmdlet to create the Custom Role Definition, as shown below. Make sure to alter the path to the json file as per your environment.\r\n\r\n    New-AzureRMRoleDefinition -InputFile \"C:\\yourCustomRole01.json\"\r\n\r\nNow you will be able to use this new Custom Role while assigning access to someone. You will be able to tweak the access and provide only the access that you need to your internal and external resources.",

They are a group of policy definitions to achieve a singular goal. These are the Microsoft recommended way to use the Policies.  \r\n\r\nE.g. You want to combine a set of policy definitions for the compute and related resources. You want to apply following set of policies:\r\n\r\n 1. Allowed locations - to restrict locations where resources can be deployed\r\n 2. Allowed SKUs - to restrict SKUs for the VMs e.g. VMs can be created with SKU Standard_DS2_v2 only\r\n 3. Enforce Tags and it's default value - to enforce the usage of Tags on resources\r\n\r\nInstead of managing and assigning the policies separately, you can club these policies together in an **Initiative Definition** and then assign the same.\r\n\r\n### Defining Initiative Definition ###\r\n\r\nTo create a new Initiative Definition you go to your Subscription and then go to the Policies section under Settings. Within Policies go to the **Definitions** section under Authoring. Here you can click on the \"Initiative Definitions\" tab to view the existing definitions. Click on the \"+Initiative definition\" to create a new Initiative Definition.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15220373735ab8727dc341d.png\" alt=\"Creating Initiative Definition\">\r\n\r\nThe new Initiative Definition blade with open up. Here you can create the definition. \r\n\r\n 1. The first section, as shown below, is similar to a Policy definition. You will provide the basic information here like Definition location, Name, Description and Category. \r\n 2. On the right side, select the Policies which want to be part of this Initiative Definition in the section \"Available Definitions\". Select and Add all the policies that you want to group together.\r\n 3. Configure parameters for the selected Policies in the \"Policies and Parameters\" section. If you selected a wrong policy, you can delete the policy in this section as well. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15220373785ab87282e8f55.png\" alt=\"Initiative Definition Blade\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### Initiative Parameters ###\r\n\r\nContinuing with the previous section of the Policy definition, you have lots of options when configuring parameters under the \"Policies and Parameters\" section. You can either \"**Set value**\" right within the Initiative Definition, or you can \"**Use Initiative Parameter**\". Set the values within the definition if you don't want to change during the assignment. If you want to set the values dynamically then use the Initiative Parameters.\r\n\r\n**Initiative Parameters** are used to parameterize the Initiative Definition. These can be set from the list of allowed values (a subset of all the values) during the assignment.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15220373835ab87287b145a.png\" alt=\"Options for setting values for Parameters\">\r\n\r\nWhen you select to use an Initiative Parameter for any value, then a parameter is automatically created. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15220373895ab8728d4f4b0.png\" alt=\"Initiative Parameters\">\r\n\r\nYou can create your own Initiative parmeters as well. If an Initiative parameter is not being used then you won't be able to save that definition. You will get \"Bad Request\" while trying to save the definition.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15220373945ab87292397f6.png\" alt=\"Option for creating new Initiative Parameter\">\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n### Assigning Initiative Definition ###\r\n\r\nThe Initiative assignment is exactly same as the Policy Assignment. All the options are similar as well. You provide value to the parameters within the Initiative Definition for all the policies, during the assignment.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15220373995ab872973ab67.png\" alt=\"Assigning Initiative Definition\">\r\n\r\n",

Now it's time to put the knowledge together and define a policy.\r\n\r\n### Getting the JSON ready for the Policy Definition ###\r\n\r\nHave the JSON ready for the Policy Definition. If you are going to deploy the policy via Portal then all you need is the Policy Rule portion of the definition. For this post, let's use the sample policy definition for \"*Only allow a certain VM platform image*\" located here: https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/azure-policy\/scripts\/allow-certain-vm-image\r\n\r\nVarious other samples are provided by Microsoft at this link: <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/azure-policy\/json-samples\" target=\"_blank\">Templates for Azure Policy<\/a>\r\n\r\nThis sample policy, enforces the end users to use only a certain version of the Ubuntu only. \r\n\r\nThe policy definition looks as below:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n        \"type\": \"Microsoft.Authorization\/policyDefinitions\",\r\n        \"name\": \"platform-image-policy\",\r\n        \"properties\": {\r\n            \"displayName\": \"Only allow a certain VM platform image\",\r\n            \"description\": \"This policy ensures that only UbuntuServer, Canonical is allowed from the image repository\",\r\n            \"parameters\": {},\r\n            \"policyRule\": {\r\n                \"if\": {\r\n                    \"allOf\": [\r\n                        {\r\n                            \"field\": \"type\",\r\n                            \"in\": [\r\n                                \"Microsoft.Compute\/disks\",\r\n                                \"Microsoft.Compute\/virtualMachines\",\r\n                                \"Microsoft.Compute\/VirtualMachineScaleSets\"\r\n                            ]\r\n                        },\r\n                        {\r\n                            \"not\": {\r\n                                \"allOf\": [\r\n                                    {\r\n                                        \"field\": \"Microsoft.Compute\/imagePublisher\",\r\n                                        \"in\": [\r\n                                            \"Canonical\"\r\n                                        ]\r\n                                    },\r\n                                    {\r\n                                        \"field\": \"Microsoft.Compute\/imageOffer\",\r\n                                        \"in\": [\r\n                                            \"UbuntuServer\"\r\n                                        ]\r\n                                    },\r\n                                    {\r\n                                        \"field\": \"Microsoft.Compute\/imageSku\",\r\n                                        \"in\": [\r\n                                            \"14.04.2-LTS\"\r\n                                        ]\r\n                                    },\r\n                                    {\r\n                                        \"field\": \"Microsoft.Compute\/imageVersion\",\r\n                                        \"in\": [\r\n                                            \"latest\"\r\n                                        ]\r\n                                    }\r\n                                ]\r\n                            }\r\n                        }\r\n                    ]\r\n                },\r\n                \"then\": {\r\n                    \"effect\": \"deny\"\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nLook at the policy rule section. Let's look at various sections more closely.\r\n\r\n 1. ***if*** condition defines the policy condition\r\n 2. ***allOf*** ensures that all the conditions must be true\r\n 3. ***field type*** is specified as Disks, Virtual Machines and VM scale sets under Microsoft.Compute\r\n 4. Next section defines a nested condition, which evaluates true if actual VM image used is not equal to combination of all of the conditions specified. \r\n 5. ***then*** section defines what should happen. In this case it says to ***deny*** the operation, i.e. the VM provisioning will fail with validation error for not conforming to the policy.\r\n\r\nNote that there are no parameters used in this policy definition.\r\n\r\n### Defining Policy using Portal ###\r\n\r\nFor defining the policies via Azure Portal, navigate to the Policies under settings of your Subscription. Click on the Definitions and then click on \"**+Policy Definition**\" at the top.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15218358115ab55f2336e11.png\" alt=\"Defining New Policy\">\r\n\r\nA new blade will open where you can define the policy. Provide the details as follows:\r\n\r\n 1. Provide the policy definition's location. This will be your subscription in which you want the definition to exist.\r\n 2. Provide a Display Name and Description of the policy. Try to be as descriptive as possible\r\n 3. Either create a new Category for the policy or use one of the existing ones\r\n 4. Copy and paste your policy definition. In the portal, only provide the \"policyRule\" section. \r\n\r\nThe section for policyRule will look something similar to below.\r\n\r\n\r\n    {\r\n        \"policyRule\": {\r\n          all content here\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15218358165ab55f28ad5a4.png\" alt=\"New Policy Definition Blade\">\r\n\r\nHit **Save** to create the Policy Definition. You can now start assigning this policy in your environment.\r\n\r\n### Defining Policy using PowerShell ###\r\n\r\nEnsure that you have latest version of Azure PowerShell installed. Then using PowerShell to deploy the policy is as easy as executing below two cmdlets:\r\n\r\n 1. ***New-AzureRmPolicyDefinition*** - to create the policy definition \r\n 2. ***New-AzureRMPolicyAssignment*** - to use the policy and assign the policy at a scope defined\r\n\r\nStore the policy in a json file on your computer. Ensure that you only save the \"if-then\" condition in curly parenthesis. This will be used as an input to the cmdlet. The file should look similar to below:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n                \"if\": { <<content here>>},\r\n                \"then\":{ <<content here>>}\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nTo create the policy definition use a code similar to below. Ensure to update the file name and path as per your environment.\r\n\r\n    $definition = $definition = New-AzureRmPolicyDefinition -Name \"RestrictingUbuntuVMVersion\" -DisplayName \"Restrict Ubuntu version for VM Deployment\" -Description \"Detailed Description here\" -Policy \"C:\\temp\\CustomPolicyDefinition.json\"\r\n    \r\n    \r\n\r\nTo use the policy, do the assignment using a code similar to below:\r\n\r\n    $assignment = New-AzureRMPolicyAssignment -Name <customAssignmentName> -Scope <SubscriptionId>  -PolicyDefinition $definition\r\n    \r\nThat is all there is to defining and using your custom policy.\r\n",

In simple terms it allows you to control access to a VM. When you enable JIT, all access is locked down on the VM on all ports. This is done via Network Security Group (NSG) rules. The access is granted only for the duration allowed and also only on the ports requested. And then everything is locked down again at the end of the duration.\r\n\r\nThe attackers are leveraging various ways to get into your environment. One such way is using Bots to automate and Brute Force method to attempt entering in your environment. If you need to access a VM, in your environment, from Internet without VPN (e.g. to change some files on a Web app VM) then you are potentially opening up 3389 port on the VM and that can become a target for the attackers. Locking down the VM except when you need it and only for the duration of the requirement, reduces these risks significantly. \r\n\r\n### Pre-requisites ###\r\n\r\nThe key pre-requisites to be able to use this feature are:\r\n\r\n 1. The Azure Security Center needs to be upgraded to Advanced Security as shown below\r\n 2. The VM on which you want to configure JIT access should have a Network Security Group (NSG) linked to it. If it doesn't have any then you can create one and associate it with the network interface of the VM.\r\n\r\nThe first pre-requisite requires you to upgrade the Security Center to Advanced Security that comes with **Standard Tier**. You can upgrade from any of the advanced features. The portal will automatically prompt you to upgrade as shown below:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15212356695aac36d55f4be.png\" alt=\"Advanced Security in Security Center\">\r\n\r\n### How to Access and Configure it ###\r\n\r\nTo configure this go to Azure **Security Center**. Within Security Center go to the \"Advanced Cloud Defense\" category and then click on \"Just in time VM access\" link as shown below:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15212354315aac35e7b2c2d.png\" alt=\"JIT in Security Center\">\r\n\r\nNext follow the below steps to enable JIT on a VM:\r\n\r\n 1. Ensure that you are in the JIT section of Security Center\r\n 2. Go to the \"Recommended\" tab. This will show you all the VMs in your environment. \r\n 3. Click on the VM for which you want to enable Just in Time access. You can select multiple VMs here.\r\n 4. Click on the \"Enable JIT on x VMs\" button\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15212369445aac3bd0c8b26.png\" alt=\"Enabling JIT\">\r\n\r\nYou will be presented with various settings for enabling JIT. These settings can be configured as:\r\n\r\n 1. By default, various common ports are configured for JIT access with 3 hours time range. E.g. 3389 for RDP. Click on any of the default ports to tweak the settings.\r\n 2. You can add more ports and protocols by clicking on the \"Add\" button at the top.\r\n 3. Tweak the settings on the new blade that opens up.\r\n 4. Click on \"Save\" to save your settings.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15212369535aac3bd974b55.png\" alt=\"Settings while enabling JIT\">\r\n\r\nThat's all there is to it. Once JIT is configured you can view the VM in the \"Configured\" tab.\r\n\r\n### Requesting access and activity log in JIT ###\r\n\r\nYou can request access and perform various other management operations by following below steps:\r\n\r\n 1. Once the JIT is configured, the VM will show up in the \"Configured\" tab as shown below. \r\n 2. Click on the VM that you want to manage or request access to. \r\n 3. As soon as you click, \"Request access\" button will start showing. You can click the button and it will ask for the number of hours that you need the access and the corresponding ports on which you need the access. Please note that only ports configured earlier can be granted access.\r\n 4. Click on the ellipse i.e. 3 dots in front of the VM record and you will see various options. Using these options you can view Properties. You can view the Activity log for previous requests and any attempts on attack. You can also Edit or Remove the access.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15212369585aac3bde79755.png\" alt=\"Requesting access and activity log in JIT\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### Adding non-Azure computers ###\r\n\r\nYou can add non-Azure computers for an extra fee per Node. Cost is calculated based on 15 USD\/Node\/Month. Resources that count as a node are VMs and computers. The selected security tier will be applied to current and new resources. For more information, visit <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/security-center\/security-center-pricing\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Security Center's Standard tier for enhanced security<\/a> information page.\r\n\r\nEnsure that you have onboarded the non-Azure computers to a linked Azure Log Analytics workspace. This is required in order to onboard non-Azure computers to Security Center.",

Part 1 is located here:  <a href=\"https:\/\/HarvestingClouds.com\/post\/troubleshooting-azure-site-recovery-asr-data-replication-not-working\/\" target=\"_blank\">Troubleshooting Azure Site Recovery (ASR) - Data Replication Not Working<\/a>\r\n\r\nGo through the part 1 before this blog as that talks about the location of logs and various preliminary steps. This blog talks about the issue where you are not even able to enable Data Replication for a server. \r\n\r\n### Preliminary Checks ###\r\n\r\nPerform the following basic checks related to connectivity:\r\n\r\n - Ensure that the ASR management server has connectivity with Azure.\r\n - Ensure connectivity between the management server (process server) and the source machine which you are trying to replicate. Ensure that the source machine is accessible from the process server.\r\n  - You will also need to enable and allow \u201cFile and Printer Sharing\u201d on the source machine in the Windows Firewall. \r\n - Ensure that the account that you use for enabling the protection has administrator rights on the source machine. This is needed for installation of the Mobility services agent on the source machine.\r\n - Also allow Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) in the Windows Firewall, if not already.\r\n - Disable remote User Account Control (UAC) if you are using local administrator account to install the mobility service.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Checking Services ###\r\n\r\nAlso, check whether the following services are running and configured correctly on the source machine:\r\n\r\n 1. If **Volume Shadow Copy(VSS)** service Startup Type is set to Disabled, change it to Automatic.\r\n 2. If **COM+ System Application(COMSysApp)** service Startup Type is to Disabled, change it to Automatic.\r\n 3. If the Microsoft **Distributed Transaction Coordinator Service (MSDTC)** Startup Type is set to Disabled, change it to Automatic.\r\n 4. If the service Startup Types were already set to Automatic, check if COM+ enumeration succeeds. a) You check COM+ enumeration by Component Services (comexp.msc) b) Browse to Component Service -> Computers -> My Computer -> COM+ Application. You should be able to expand the System Application node and see the contents under that node. c) Ensure that Volume Shadow Copy Service is listed under Component Service -> Computers -> My Computer -> DCOM config\r\n\r\n### Alternate Option ###\r\n\r\nIf for any reason you can't enable any of the above steps, e.g. if you can't provide admin access to the service account on the source machine or disable remote UAC, then you have an alternative option. You can install the Mobility services agent on the source machine prior to enabling the protection. You will still need the services to be configured appropriately but will not need admin access while enabling the protection. To install the mobility services agent, you have various options:\r\n\r\n* [Install using software deployment tools like System Center Configuration Manager](vmware-azure-mobility-install-configuration-mgr.md)\r\n* [Install with Azure Automation and Desired State Configuration (Automation DSC)](vmware-azure-mobility-deploy-automation-dsc.md)\r\n* [Install manually from the UI](vmware-azure-install-mobility-service.md#install-mobility-service-manually-by-using-the-gui)\r\n* [Install manually from a command prompt](vmware-azure-install-mobility-service.md#install-mobility-service-manually-at-a-command-prompt)\r\n* [Install using the Site Recovery push installation](vmware-azure-install-mobility-service.md#install-mobility-service-by-push-installation-from-azure-site-recovery)\r\n\r\n\r\nAll these options are described in details here: <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/site-recovery\/vmware-azure-install-mobility-service\" target=\"_blank\">Install the Mobility service<\/a>\r\n\r\n### Next Steps ###\r\n\r\nRestart the job after ensuring all the pre-requisites as described in previous sections. If you are still facing issues, revisit the Part 1 of the troubleshooting series as mentioned at the beginning of this blog. Let us know in comments below if the issue persists. \r\n",

All posts in the series can be found here: <a href=\"https:\/\/HarvestingClouds.com\/post\/demystifying-azure-security-series-index\/\" target=\"_blank\">Demystifying Azure Security - Series Index<\/a>. Ensure that you have read earlier blogs about the basics of Azure Policies before reading this blog.\r\n\r\n### Structure of a Policy JSON Definition ###\r\n\r\nPolicy definitions are written in JSON. The policy definition contains elements for:\r\n\r\n - mode\r\n - parameters\r\n - display name\r\n - description\r\n - policy rule\r\n  - logical evaluation\r\n  - effect\r\n\r\nLet's understand these components with the help of an example. Earlier we saw how to find the definition of existing policies. One such policy is: \"Allowed locations\". This policy restricts the location in Azure where resources can be deployed. The definition for the policy looks like below:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      \"properties\": {\r\n        \"mode\": \"all\",\r\n        \"parameters\": {\r\n          \"allowedLocations\": {\r\n            \"type\": \"array\",\r\n            \"metadata\": {\r\n              \"description\": \"The list of locations that can be specified when deploying resources\",\r\n              \"strongType\": \"location\",\r\n              \"displayName\": \"Allowed locations\"\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n        },\r\n        \"displayName\": \"Allowed locations\",\r\n        \"description\": \"This policy enables you to restrict the locations your organization can specify when deploying resources.\",\r\n        \"policyRule\": {\r\n          \"if\": {\r\n            \"not\": {\r\n              \"field\": \"location\",\r\n              \"in\": \"[parameters('allowedLocations')]\"\r\n            }\r\n          },\r\n          \"then\": {\r\n            \"effect\": \"deny\"\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n 1. **Mode** tells you the type of resources for which the policy will be applied. Allowed values are \"All\" (where all Resource Groups and Resources are evaluated) and \"indexed\" (where policy is evaluated only for resources which support tags and location)\r\n 2. **Parameters** are used for providing inputs to the policy. They can be reused at multiple locations within the policy. You can refer to a parameter as: \"***[parameters('allowedLocations')]***\"\r\n 3. **Display Name** is used to show the policy in the portal or programmatically.\r\n 4. A **description** is used to provide details for the policy.\r\n 5. **Policy Rule** is which defines the policies. This is the section where the restrictions are defined in a Poicy Definition. To understand a policy you need to focus most of your efforts on this section. Every Policy rule has two key sections defined under \"if-then\" blocks. \r\n  6. **Logical Evaluation** is defined under the \"if\" block. It defines the condition which is evaluated to determine the policy should be applied or not.\r\n  7. **Effect** is defined in the \"then\" block. This defines what will happen if the condition is met. \r\n\r\n### Policy Rules ###\r\n\r\nLet's look at the policy rules in more details. The general syntax of the \"if-then\" block is as shown below:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      \"if\": {\r\n        <condition> | <logical operator>\r\n      },\r\n      \"then\": {\r\n        \"effect\": \"deny | audit | append\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nSupported logical operators are:\r\n\r\n* `\"not\": {condition  or operator}`\r\n* `\"allOf\": [{condition or operator},{condition or operator}]`\r\n* `\"anyOf\": [{condition or operator},{condition or operator}]`\r\n\r\n**Not** operator means that the opposit of the condition should be true for the policy to be applied. **AllOf** requires all the conditions defined to be true at the same time. **AnyOf** requires any one of the conditions to be true for the policy to be applied.\r\n\r\nIn the previous example, the policy rule section is as shown below:\r\n\r\n        \"policyRule\": {\r\n          \"if\": {\r\n            \"not\": {\r\n              \"field\": \"location\",\r\n              \"in\": \"[parameters('allowedLocations')]\"\r\n            }\r\n          },\r\n          \"then\": {\r\n            \"effect\": \"deny\"\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, the rule above says that if the location is not in the list of allowed locations, defined by the parameter ***allowedLocations***, then the effect will be ***deny*** i.e. the resource creation will not be allowed.\r\n\r\nYou can find the complete list of operators and conditional constructs here: <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/azure-policy\/policy-definition\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Policy definition structure\r\n<\/a>",

This provides you with granular control over what a policy should perform and what should be allowed and what should be denied.\r\n\r\nPolicies are writing in JSON format. It is always good to base your custom policy definition on one of the built-in policies if one exists which is closer to what you are trying to do. \r\n\r\n### Viewing Definition of Existing Policies ###\r\n\r\nYou have two options to view the definition of an existing policy.\r\n\r\n 1. Using PowerShell\r\n 2. Using Azure Portal\r\n\r\n### Using PowerShell ###\r\n\r\n**Using PowerShell** run the below cmdlet to view all the policies in your environment.\r\n\r\n    Get-AzureRmPolicyDefinition\r\n\r\nThen go through the list and find the policy that you want to use. Find the ResourceId of that policy and then run the below cmdlet to fetch the details of that policy.\r\n\r\n    Get-AzureRmPolicyDefinition -Id \"\/providers\/Microsoft.Authorization\/policyDefinitions\/e56962a6-4747-49cd-b67b-bf8b01975c4c\"\r\n\r\n### Using Azure Portal ###\r\n\r\n**Using Azure Portal** to view the Definition is also very easy. Simply navigate to:\r\n\r\n - the Subscription section in the Azure Portal\r\n - Select your subscription\r\n - Click on \"Policies\" under settings. \r\n - Within the Policies blade, click on \"Definitions\"\r\n\r\nWithin the Policy Definitions, select the Policy from the list for which you want to view the definition. Click on the 3 dots to the right. From the context menu select \"View definition\".\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15218187805ab51c9c095ce.png\" alt=\"Policy Definitions\">\r\n\r\nThis will open up another blade. Click on the \"Json\" tab at the top and this will show you the rule part of the definition of the policy. the rule is the most important part of the policy. We will look at other components of the policies later as well.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15218187845ab51ca0c313d.png\" alt=\"Policy Definition Details\">\r\n\r\nE.g. The JSON for \"Allowed storage account SKUs\" built-in policy looks as shown below.\r\n\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      \"if\": {\r\n        \"allOf\": [\r\n          {\r\n            \"field\": \"type\",\r\n            \"equals\": \"Microsoft.Storage\/storageAccounts\"\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            \"not\": {\r\n              \"field\": \"Microsoft.Storage\/storageAccounts\/sku.name\",\r\n              \"in\": \"[parameters('listOfAllowedSKUs')]\"\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n        ]\r\n      },\r\n      \"then\": {\r\n        \"effect\": \"Deny\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nNext, we will dissect and understand the Policy structure in details.",

Policy assignment is very easy on the Azure Portal. We will be assigning a built-in policy at a subscription scope.\r\n\r\n### Accessing the Policies in the Azure portal ###\r\n\r\nBegin by accessing the Policies in the Azure Portal. To do this follow the below steps:\r\n\r\n 1. Navigate to **Subscriptions** (via All Services or the navigation sidebar)\r\n 2. Select the subscription for which you want to view the Policies\r\n 3. Scroll down to the \"Settings\" category in the menu of the subscription\r\n 4. Click on \"**Policies**\" to access the policies in Azure\r\n\r\n### Assigning the Built-in Policies ###\r\n\r\nTo perform the assignment, click on \"Assign Policy\" from either Compliance or the Assignment tabs.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15217866825ab49f3a81d6a.png\" alt=\"Assign Policy\">\r\n\r\nIn the new blade, provide the value for the:\r\n\r\n 1. Policy to be applied\r\n 2. Name and Description of the Policy. The name will be the name of the policy selected by default. As a best practice ensure to provide the detailed description.\r\n 3. Assigned by will be your name by default\r\n 4. You can select the pricing tier between Free and Standard. You will get the compliance evaluation of the resources in your environment against the policy with the Standard pricing tier\r\n 5. Scope for the Policy\r\n 6. Exclusions from the Policy\r\n 7. Any additional parameters related to the policy\r\n\r\nTo select from the policies, click on the blue button with an ellipse (i.e. 3 dots) in front of the Policy box. This will popup another blade for all the Policy definitions.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15217894075ab4a9df6a23e.png\" alt=\"Assign Policy Blade details\">\r\n\r\nScroll through various Built-in policies. Once we define any custom user-defined policies, they will also be displayed here. Select the policy \"Allowed locations\" from the list of the policies as an example. Click on \"Select\" once done.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15217894445ab4aa0494a0d.png\" alt=\"Selecting Policy\">\r\n\r\nSelect the Scope for applying the policy. You can leave the default to the Subscription level. Or you can click on the blue button in front of scope text box and select the Resource Groups under the subscription on which you want to apply the policy.\r\n\r\nYou can also select the Exclusions if you require. These Resource Group or resources will not be evaluated against the policy.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15217894615ab4aa15470ec.png\" alt=\"Selecting Scope\">\r\n\r\nLastly, you will have additional parameters for the policy related values. These parameters will vary and will depend on the policy you have selected. E.g. For \"Allowed locations\" policy, you will see the parameter for allowed locations. Select \"East US\" and \"East US 2\" for the locations as an example.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15217894765ab4aa248f15f.png\" alt=\"Providing value for Policy related Parameters\">\r\n\r\nOnce you complete the configurations, click on the \"**Assign**\" button to apply the policy\r\n\r\n### Validating the Policy ###\r\n\r\nTo validate the policy for \"Allowed locations\" follow these steps:\r\n\r\n 1. Try to deploy a Storage Account or a VM or any other resource in a location that is NOT allowed. E.g. try deploying a storage account in the \"West US\" location. This should fail with the validation error stating the policy id.\r\n 2. Perform the same deployment but to one of the allowed location. E.g. try deploying a storage account in the \"East US\" location. This should succeed without any erros. ",

The focus is to provide only the access necessary so that an account in your organization doesn't have more access than needed. In case the account gets compromised, this will ensure that does not leave your environment too much vulnerable. This means that if you grant an employee access to manage Virtual Machines in your environment, that employee can't alter the virtual networks by mistake or have any access to delete the storage accounts in the environment. \r\n\r\n### Roles Hierarchy ###\r\n\r\nThe RBAC Roles can be assigned at the following three levels in the order of hierarchy:\r\n\r\n 1. **Subscription**\r\n 2. **Resource Group**\r\n 3. **Resource**\r\n\r\nAny Resource in Azure, must belong to a Resource Group (under the ARM model). And every Resource Group in Azure must belong to a single subscription.\r\n\r\nIf a person is assigned scope at Subscription level then he\/she will get access to all Resource Groups and to all resources within those resource groups. Next, if a person is assigned access at a Resource Group level then they will automatically get access to all the Resources within that Resource Group. Finally, if a person is provided access only to an individual Resource then they will get access only to that Resource.\r\n\r\n### Built-in Roles ###\r\nThere are various inbuilt roles for this purpose like:\r\n\r\n 1. Contributor - create and manage but can't grant access to others\r\n 2. Reader - can only view\r\n 3. Owner - full access\r\n\r\nThe complete list of Built-in roles can be viewed here: <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/active-directory\/role-based-access-built-in-roles\" target=\"_blank\">Built-in roles for Azure role-based access control<\/a>\r\n\r\n### Viewing and Adding Access ###\r\n\r\nTo view or Add access, first decide the scope where you want to provide the access. Select the scope, e.g. a Resource Group on which you want to view existing access and grant the access to someone. Then follow these steps (as per the image below):\r\n\r\n 1. Click on \"Access Control (IAM)\" to access the RBAC access control\r\n 2. View the access in the center area. Scroll down to view all type of roles and Users, Groups or Apps with the access\r\n 3. Click on \"+Add\" button, as shown below, to add access to a new user, group or application\r\n 4. In the new popup blade, select the Role (e.g. Contributor), Assignment scope and name\/email address of the user or app to whom you want to grant the access. You can select multiple users\/apps as well.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15216952115ab339eba24e0.png\" alt=\"Viewing and Adding RBAC Access\">\r\n\r\nWithin each subscription, you can grant up to 2000 role assignments.\r\n\r\nLearn about creating Custom RBAC Roles here: <a href=\"https:\/\/HarvestingClouds.com\/post\/demystifying-azure-security-custom-rbac-roles\/\" target=\"_blank\">Demystifying Azure Security - Custom RBAC Roles<\/a>",

The policies make your environment compliant and ensure that you adhere to the service level agreements and standards set within your organization. If the end user tries to deploy a resource violating the policies then the deployment fails at the validation step ensuring that your environment remains compliant. If you already have resources which are not compliant then you will be able to review those and take necessary actions.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Examples of Azure Policies ###\r\n\r\nHere are a few of most commonly used policies:\r\n\r\n 1. **Restricting the Allowed locations** where a resource can be deployed. You can restrict the allowed locations where resources can be deployed to the ones that are closer to your geographic location. This also ensures that the users within your organization can't deploy resources to noncompliant locations. \r\n 2. **Enforcing a Tag** and it's Value. E.g. You have a Resource Group for the Finance department. You want to ensure that any resource deployed in that Resource Group should be tagged with a \"CostCenter\" and a specific value for that cost center. You can enforce this using a Policy.\r\n 3. **Not Allowed Resource Types**. Using this policy you can prohibit the deployment of certain resource types in your environment. \r\n\r\nThere are various other built-in Policies. You can also create your own policies which we will discuss in more detail later.\r\n\r\n### Scope where a Policy is Assigned ###\r\n\r\nA Policy can be assigned at the below levels:\r\n\r\n 1. **Subscription** level - Applied to all Resource Groups and Resources within the subscription\r\n 2. **Resource Group** level - Applied only to the Resources within the selected Resource Groups\r\n\r\n**Exclusions**: In addition to the assignment scope, you can exclude certain Resource Groups or individual Resources from the Policy assignments. The Policy will be applied to all the Resources in the scope except the ones excluded by defining the Exclusions. \r\n\r\n\r\n### How are Policies different from Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) ###\r\n\r\nThrough **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**, you focus on the role and scope of access that a user can have in Azure. You provide the access control (IAM) within Azure for Subscription, Resource Group or an individual Resource. You define a role for the user\/app\/group like Contributor, Reader etc.  You can use the built-in roles or can define custom roles.\r\n\r\nWith **Policies**, you focus on the properties of the resources with which the user can work at the defined scope. You define what properties are allowed and what is restricted. You can use the built-in policies or can define your own.\r\n\r\nE.g. Through RBAC you define that a particular user has Reader role at the subscription and Contributor role at a particular Resource Group. This will mean that the user can view all the resources in the subscription but can only modify or create resources in the Resource Group where he has Contributor access.\r\n\r\nNow if you define a policy which restricts the type of resources deployed ( as discussed in the examples above), the user will not be able to deploy the restricted resource types, even though he has contributor access to a Resource Group.\r\n\r\n### Accessing Policies in the Azure portal ###\r\n\r\nTo access the Policies in the Azure portal:\r\n\r\n 1. Navigate to **Subscriptions** (via All Services or the navigation sidebar)\r\n 2. Select the subscription for which you want to view the Policies\r\n 3. Scroll down to the \"Settings\" category in the menu of the subscription\r\n 4. Click on \"**Policies**\" to access the policies in Azure\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/15217849365ab4986888c88.png\" alt=\"Policies in Azure Portal\">\r\n\r\nWe will be discussing more about the Azure Policies in later blogs.",

		"body": "Azure Managed Disks bring lots of advantages and benefits to the table when compared to Azure Storage Account based VM disks. The first thing to note is that these are only related to VM disks and not general blob storage. In this post, lets take a look at what all benefits you get when you create your virtual machine with a managed disk instead of a storage account based disks.\r\n\r\n### More Controlled Access Management\r\n\r\nLet's assume a scenario where all the disks for the virtual machines in your environment belonged to a particular storage account. Let us say that there are VMs belonging to Finance as well as HR departments. Now if you want to give access to a VHD file of a VM belonging to HR department, you will provide the access to the storage account. This was the lowest level where you could provide the access. This inadvertently opened the access to the Finance VM's VHD files as well.\r\n\r\nManaged Disks are individual resources in Azure. If a VM has 1 OS disk and 2 data disks, all implemented as a managed disk, then you can even provide the access to one of the data disk and not provide access to any of the other disks.\r\n\r\n### No Storage account service limits\r\n\r\nEarlier with storage accounts there were Service Limits related to IOPS at the storage account level. When the infrastructure grew and there comes a time the number of disks grew to a point that this service limit will be hit and this can affect your architecture. With managed disks, you are no longer limited by the storage account limits.\r\n\r\n### Ability to take Snapshot\r\n\r\nNow with managed disks you have the capability to take snapshots on the fly. You can later restore from these snapshots as required. You can take these snapshots onto a different storage account.\r\n\r\n### Ability to Capture better images\r\n\r\nThe images that you capture on the Vms, which are created using managed disks, will not just include the OS disk, but will also include all the data disk.\r\n\r\n### Ability to convert a Standard disk to Premium disk and vice versa\r\n\r\nEarlier if you wanted to convert a standard disk to a premium disk (or vice versa) you needed to create a new storage account and copy over the disk. Now with managed disks, this is as easy as shutting down the virtual machine and just changing a value in a drop down.\r\n\r\n### Other benefits\r\n\r\nOther benefits include:\r\n\r\n - Better reliability for Availability Sets\r\n - Highly durable and available with design for 99.999% availability\r\n - Better Azure Backup service support with the ability to create a backup job with time-based backups, easy VM restoration, and backup retention policies\r\n\r\nReference: \r\n\r\n - <a href=\"https:\/\/azure.microsoft.com\/en-ca\/services\/managed-disks\/\" target=\"_blank\">Managed Disks product page<\/a>\r\n - <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/virtual-machines\/windows\/managed-disks-overview\" target=\"_blank\">Managed Disks overview<\/a>",

Your website may be talking about a code sample that your visitor may want to try in Azure. Instead of opening a new instance of Azure Portal, the visitors can try the command right from your site if you have embedded the cloud shell in your website.\r\n\r\nAll you need is the embed code and you are all set. Just add this code to your site and then you will be able to launch the cloud shell right from there with just a click of a button.Behind the scene, this is nothing but hyperlinking to the URL: https:\/\/shell.azure.com\r\n\r\n### Embed Code ###\r\nThe embed code is as follows if you are using Markdown\r\n\r\n    [![Launch Cloud Shell](https:\/\/shell.azure.com\/images\/launchcloudshell.png \"Launch Cloud Shell\")](https:\/\/shell.azure.com)\r\n\r\nIf you are building a website in HTML then the embed code will look like:\r\n\r\n    <a style=\"cursor:pointer\" onclick='javascript:window.open(\"https:\/\/shell.azure.com\", \"_blank\", \"toolbar=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,menubar=no,location=no,status=no\")'><image src=\"https:\/\/shell.azure.com\/images\/launchcloudshell.png\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code in Action ###\r\n\r\nClicking on below image will open a popup.

		"body": "**Azure Cloud Shell** is a very convenient option to run your automation scripts against your subscriptions. \r\n\r\nThe shell is provided in two flavors:\r\n\r\n - Bash based shell\r\n - PowerShell in Cloud Shell (currently in Preview)\r\n\r\nThe Cloud Shell is a Browser based experience. What this means is that you do not need to install any dependencies for the Azure commands to run. Also, there is no dependency on your machine's hardware. You can work irrespective of your local machine's configurations.\r\n\r\n### Support for various tools\r\nAzure Cloud Shell comes preloaded with various tools depending upon the shell type selected. It comes loaded with Linux tools like bash, sh, tmux and dig. The Azure tools which are preloaded are Azure CLI 2.0 and 1.0, AzCopy,etc.Text editors include vim and nano. Git source control tools are also included. Various other Build, Containers, Databases, etc. tools are also included. It also comes with language support for .net version 2.0.0, Java version 1.8, Node.js 6.9.4, PowerShell 6.0(beta) and Python 2.7 and 3.5 etc. Check the References section for the full list and up to date version of Tools and Language support.\r\n\r\n### Key Concepts\r\n\r\nBelow are some of the key concepts (in nutshell) about the cloud shell.\r\n\r\n 1. You can opt for any one of the two shell options available, as per your preferences. You can choose to have a **Bash shell** or **PowerShell in Cloud shell**\r\n 2. You can easily switch between the two shells at any time\r\n 3. If you are logged into Azure portal then you are also automatically authenticated into the Azure Cloud Shell\r\n\r\nOther important concepts as per Microsoft documentation are:\r\n\r\n 1. Cloud Shell runs on a temporary host provided on a per-session,\r\n    per-user basis \r\n 2. Cloud Shell times out after 20 minutes without\r\n    interactive activity \r\n 3. Cloud Shell requires an Azure file share to be\r\n    mounted \r\n 4. Cloud Shell uses the same Azure file share for both Bash and\r\n    PowerShell \r\n 5. Cloud Shell is assigned one machine per user account \r\n 6. Bash persists $Home using a 5-GB image held in your file share\r\n 7. Permissions are set as a regular Linux user in Bash\r\n\r\n### Pricing\r\n\r\nCloud Shell does not have any direct cost linked to it. The charge for Cloud Shell is only for the usage of the underlying Azure Storage. The exact charge depends on the amount you store on that storage and the type of the storage. By default, Locally Redundant Storage is created. \r\n\r\n**References**:\r\n\r\n - <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/cloud-shell\/overview\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Cloud Shell Overview<\/a>\r\n - <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/cloud-shell\/features\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Cloud Shell Features and Tools<\/a>\r\n - <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/cloud-shell\/features-powershell\" target=\"_blank\">Features & tools for PowerShell in Azure Cloud Shell<\/a>\r\n",

They add very valuable metadata to the Azure resources. \r\nIn nutshell, tags are Key-Value pairs. E.g. \"Business Unit = Finance\", \"Site = Central US\" are two such tags.\r\n\r\nThese **tags help you to**:\r\n\r\n - Organize your resources and manage the same\r\n - Get insights into Chargeback categorically\r\n\r\nTags go beyond the boundaries of deployments. You can have few resources deployed in one resource group and few other resources into the second resource group. If for these resources in both the resource groups you apply the same tag (i.e. same Key and value combination) then you can view and manage these resources in a single click.\r\n\r\nNow once in a while, you want to take a health check of your Azure environment. You want to see what all resources are there and what are the tags applied to these resources. You want to extract this data to a CSV file so that you can apply filters and perform other business intellegence (BI) operations on it. The script below provides exactly that. \r\n\r\nThe **script gives you** a CSV output report with:\r\n\r\n - All the resources in your Azure Subscription\r\n - Type of each resource, so that you can filter on various types\r\n - Tags for each of the resource in Azure\r\n\r\n**The Columns** in the Output CSV file (generated by the script) are:\r\n\r\n 1. Semi-colon separated list of tags\r\n 2. Resource Name\r\n 3. Resource Group Name\r\n 4. Location\r\n 5. Resource Type\r\n 6. Resource Id\r\n 7. Name\r\n 8.

		],
		"category": "Azure",
		"body": "If you have the Azure Site Recovery (ASR) setup in your environment and are facing the issue where the data replication is stuck, then follow this blog to troubleshoot. The data replication can be stuck either during the initial replication or during the delta changes. This can occur for various reasons. We will inspect various components involved in ASR. Major of the troubleshooting is done on the Management Server i.e. the on-premise Configuration\/Master target server.\r\n\r\n### 1. Check Alerts Details ###\r\n\r\nGo to the Azure Site Recovery Vault and navigate to the settings. Click on the ***Alerts and Events***. Check the alerts for the data replication being blocked etc. Verify that the problem is related to data replication and not something else. \r\n\r\nYou can also navigate to the \"***Replicated Items***\" in the ASR Vault settings. On the blade for replicated items, click on the server for which the data is not being replicated. A new blade will open for this server's properties Then click on the Error Details on the server properties blade's context menu (which you can access by clicking on the top right ellipse i.e. 3 dots).\r\n\r\nAfter verifying the issue, proceed to next sections to troubleshoot.\r\n\r\n### 2. Check Resource Monitor ###\r\n\r\nCheck if you see any activity in the Resource Monitor. This is also to validate if the issue is there or not. Sometimes the **Low Bandwidth** and **multiple servers** configured against one Management server can cause this issue. Ensure that this is not the scenario in your case.\r\n\r\nFrom the Task manager, go to performance view and check for the bandwidth consumption. Then click on the \"Open Resource Monitor\" button to launch the Resource Monitor. From the CPU section in the Overview tab, select the below two services:\r\n\r\n - cxps.exe\r\n - cbengine.exe\r\n\r\nThen click on the Network tab and see if there is any traffic going out to Azure. If the data transfer is going on without issues then you should be able to view entries against cbengine going out to a URL which will look something like \"blob.aaa1aaa1aa.core.windows.net\" and entries against the csps service .\r\n\r\n![Resource Monitor](\/images\/1479242042582b713a13d26.png)\r\n\r\n### 3. Check ASR Infrastructure Setup ###\r\n\r\nFirst of all, check if the ASR infrastructure setup is correct and nothing is wrong there. To view this, navigate to the ASR Vault. Go to the settings and click on the \"Site Recovery Infrastructure\". In the next blade, click on the kind of infrastructure you have setup. E.g. If you are replicating from VMWare or Physical Machines from on-premise to Azure then click on the \"Configuration Servers\" under the \"For VMWare & Physical Machines\" section.\r\n\r\n![Site Recovery Infrastructure](\/images\/1479235374582b572e7bd28.png)\r\n\r\nHere check if the Config Server is showing as \"Connected\". If not then the problem is in the communication between Configuration Server and the Azure. Ensure that you are able to connect to the Azure portal from the config server. Also, ensure that all the public URLs for Azure are accessible. Check this link for exact URLs: [Verify URL Access](https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/site-recovery\/site-recovery-best-practices#verify-url-access).\r\n\r\nNext, click on the configuration server. This will open another blade with details for the configuration server. Expand the section for \"Associated Servers\" as marked no. 2 in the screenshot below. Check if all the associated servers, i.e. Process Server, vCenter Server and Master Target servers are connected and showing green tick mark.\r\n\r\nNext, check the configuration server health as shown at no. 3 below. Check if all the services are running and showing healthy. Ensure that you have sufficient free space on the configuration server to send the replication data. If you see any services not running then go to the next section to check and start the services on the Management Server on-premise. \r\n\r\nYou can try refreshing the server after making any configuration changes on it, e.g. increasing memory or freeing up disk space. Click on the \"Refresh Server\" button as shown at no. 4, at the top of the blade for the configuration server.\r\n\r\n![Config Server Settings](\/images\/1479235804582b58dc26f55.png)\r\n\r\n### 4. Checking Services on the Management Server ###\r\n\r\nCheck if the services on the Management Server are up and running. You need to check for the below services:\r\n\r\n - InMage PushInstall\r\n - InMage Scout Application Service\r\n - InMage Scout VX Agent - Sentinel\/Outpost\r\n - INMAGE-AppScheduler\r\n - Microsoft Azure Recovery Services Agent\r\n - Microsoft Azure Site Recovery Service\r\n - cxprocessserver (This is important service. It is the service for the InMage CX Process Server)\r\n - tmansvc (This is the service for the InMage Volsync Thread Manager Service)\r\n\r\nStart any service which is not running and check if the problem still exists. 90% of the time the problem is going to be because of something related to these services (e.g. a restart or patch stopped one of these services).\r\n\r\n### 5. Checking Services on the Server being replicated ###\r\n\r\nCheck if the services on the Server being replicated are up and running. You need to check for the below services:\r\n\r\n - Azure Site Recovery VSS Provider\r\n - InMage Scout Application Service\r\n - InMage Scout VX Agent - Sentinel\/Outpost\r\n\r\nStart any service which is not running and check if the problem still exists.\r\n\r\n### 6. Verify Service Account credentials are correct and have required access ###\r\n\r\nThe replication can stop if the service account is not correct or it doesn't have required access. Check if the service account's password expired or changed. \r\n\r\nYou can use the Configuration Server config tool to check and update the service accounts. This tool can be accessed from this directory path: \"*D:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Azure Site Recovery\\home\\svsystems\\bin*\" where D is your install directory for ASR setup. The tool name under this directory is \"**cspsconfigtool.exe**\".\r\n\r\n![CSPS Config Tool](\/images\/1479238579582b63b3688bd.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### 7. Check Logs ###\r\n\r\nThere are various ASR logs that gets generated in the Management server. Two key logs that you should check are as shown below. This assumes that D is the directory where ASR is installed.\r\n\r\n - **Monitoring Logs** - These logs are located at \"*D:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Azure Site Recovery\\home\\svsystems\\var*\". Name of the file you should check is \"**monitor_ps**\".\r\n - **VM-Specific ASR Logs** - These logs are located at \"*D:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Azure Site Recovery\\home\\svsystems*\". Then there will be a folder with the name as a GUID for each VM. Navigate to the folder with the Guid and try to find the folder for your VM's GUID. One indication will be the number of disks and the disk sizes. Once you have located the folder for one of the VM having replication problems. Then navigate to internal folders and locate the perf.log file for your VM's disks. Check to see if there are any errors here.\r\n\r\nThese logs should give you an idea as to what may have been causing the issues.\r\n\r\n### In Conclusion ###\r\nAfter all these steps and any changes you should Refresh the Configuration Server as shown in the point 3 above. \r\n\r\nLet me know if this blog helped in your scenario.

If you want to make the template for all the resources in a Resource Group in Azure, then go to the properties of the Resource Group and find the option for \"**Automation Script**\".\r\n 2. If you want to get the template only for a particular resource, then navigate to that resource in the Azure Portal and then open it's settings. You will find the same \"**Automation Script**\" option. \r\n\r\nYou can check this option in the below screenshot.\r\n\r\n ![Automation Script](\/images\/1477349409580e902123ab1.png)\r\n\r\nOnce you click on the Automation Script option in the settings (of a resource group or a resource) then you will be presented with the complete JSON template along with the JSON outline on the right side (marked 2 above in the image).\r\n\r\nYou have various options for the actions to take on the template (marked 3 in the image above):\r\n\r\n - You can download the template\r\n - Add to Library to deploy the same resources again and again in your subscription\r\n - To directly deploy the resources again with the modifications you make. \r\n\r\nNormally, you would download the template to make edits to the same. After downloading, you should start cleaning up the template. There are only 4 major tasks that you need to perform as part of the cleanup:\r\n\r\n 1. Remove any **hard-coded values** for various dependent resources e.g. NIC for a VM, VHD for a VM etc.\r\n 2. Remove any resources and dependent parameters that you don't need.\r\n 3. Create **Parameters** for the values you want to change for each deployment and want the end user to provide during the deployment.\r\n 4. Create **Variables** for the values which can have fixed values but are being used at multiple locations in your template.\r\n\r\nThat's all there is to it. Using this tip you can spearhead your ARM Template developments. You don't need to start from scratch and can base your templates on the existing deployments.",

This extension resource should be of type \"**CustomScriptExtension**\". You provide the URLs to the PowerShell scripts inside this custom script extension.\r\n\r\n### Preparation ###\r\n\r\nAs part of the preparation process you need to:\r\n\r\n - Ensure that the PowerShell scripts are uploaded to the Storage Account and that you have the complete URL to the blob. \r\n - Or you can upload the scripts to the GitHub and get the Raw file URL\r\n - If there are more than one scripts then there should be one master script amongst all ps1 files which will internally invoke other files. This master file will be triggered via the template. Information of all file URLs will also be provided via the Template\r\n\r\n### Providing and configuring Scripts to Run After VM Deployment ###\r\n\r\nDefine the below resource to provide PowerShell scripts to be run after VM deployment:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n       \"type\": \"Microsoft.Compute\/virtualMachines\/extensions\",\r\n       \"name\": \"MyCustomScriptExtension\",\r\n       \"apiVersion\": \"2015-05-01-preview\",\r\n       \"location\": \"[parameters('location')]\",\r\n       \"dependsOn\": [\r\n           \"[concat('Microsoft.Compute\/virtualMachines\/',parameters('vmName'))]\"\r\n       ],\r\n       \"properties\": {\r\n           \"publisher\": \"Microsoft.Compute\",\r\n           \"type\": \"CustomScriptExtension\",\r\n           \"typeHandlerVersion\": \"1.7\",\r\n           \"autoUpgradeMinorVersion\":true,\r\n           \"settings\": {\r\n               \"fileUris\": [\r\n               \"http:\/\/Yourstorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net\/customscriptfiles\/start.ps1\",\r\n               \"http:\/\/Yourstorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net\/customscriptfiles\/secondaryScript.ps1\",\r\n\r\n           ],\r\n           \"commandToExecute\": \"powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -File start.ps1\"\r\n         }\r\n       }\r\n     }\r\n\r\n**How it works:**\r\n\r\n - Both the files i.e. start.ps1 and secondaryScript.ps1 are picked up from the storage account after VM deployment. Ensure to replace the URLs with your actual storage account blob URLs. You can add more files if needed.\r\n - The \"start.ps1\" is the main powerShell script which should be invoking the secondaryScript.ps1 internally\r\n - CommandToExecutre property is used to invoke the start.ps1 powerShell script on the deployed VM\r\n\r\n### Passing Parameters to the PowerShell Script dynamically ###\r\n\r\nTo pass the parameters to the PowerShell script use commandToExecute property. \r\n\r\nOne such example to pass the parameters is shown below:\r\n\r\n    \"commandToExecute\": \"[concat('powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -File start.ps1', ' -domainName ', parameters('domainNameParameter')]\"\r\n\r\nNote the use of \"concat\" helper function to create the value of the \"commandToExecute\". Also note that there is starting and trailing space in the second argument of the concat i.e. \" -domainName \".\r\n\r\nThe parameter \"domainNameParameter\" should already be defined in the template in the parameters section. If the value of parameter \"domainNameParameter\" is \"testdomain.com\" then the dynamically generated command will become:\r\n\r\n    powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -File start.ps1 -domainName testdomain.com\r\n\r\n### Securing the Access to the PowerShell Script File in Storage account ###\r\n\r\nLet us assume you want to deploy Windows VM with Protected settings. Then use the below sample to provide the PowerShell files.\r\n\r\n    {\r\n        \"publisher\": \"Microsoft.Compute\",\r\n        \"type\": \"CustomScriptExtension\",\r\n        \"typeHandlerVersion\": \"1.7\",\r\n        \"settings\": {\r\n            \"fileUris\": [\r\n                \"http: \/\/Yourstorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net\/customscriptfiles\/start.ps1\"\r\n            ]\r\n        },\r\n        \"protectedSettings\": {\r\n            \"commandToExecute\": \"powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -start.ps1\",\r\n            \"storageAccountName\": \"yourStorageAccountName\",\r\n            \"storageAccountKey\": \"yourStorageAccountKey\"\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNote the use of \"protectedSettings\" above. This time you also specify the Storage Account Name and the Storage Account Key.\r\n\r\nYou can also refer the official documentation here: [Windows VM Custom Script extensions with Azure Resource Manager templates](https:\/\/azure.microsoft.com\/en-us\/documentation\/articles\/virtual-machines-windows-extensions-customscript\/).",

Click on the Secrets and then the + Add button at the top, as shown below:\r\n<br \/><br \/>\r\n<img alt=\"Adding Secret\" src=\"\/images\/1476818644580676d447b16.png\" \/>\r\n<br \/><br \/>\r\nNext, in the \"Create a secret\" blade, set the Upload Options to Manual. Provide a name and value to the secret. Value is the password you want to securely save.\r\nEnsure that the Enabled is set to Yes. Optionally you can set the activation and expiration dates. In this example, we are setting the Secret Name to \"DefaultAdminPasswordSecret\".\r\n<br \/><br \/>\r\n<img alt=\"Creating Secret\" src=\"\/images\/1476818650580676da89fee.png\" \/>\r\n    <\/li>\r\n\r\n    <li>\r\n        Next, we will set the <b>Access Policies <\/b> to provide access to the user under the context of which the template will be deployed. This is the user which will be accessing the Key Vault. Go to Key Vault settings and select Access Policies. Add the new user as shown below:\r\n<br \/><br \/>\r\n<img alt=\"Access Policies\" src=\"\/images\/14768190995806789bad0c4.png\" \/>\r\n<br \/><br \/>\r\n\r\n    <\/li>\r\n\r\n    <li>\r\n        Next, we will set the <b>Advanced Access Policies <\/b> to indicate that this key vault can be accessed via ARM Templates. Go to Key Vault settings and select Advanced Access Policies. Ensure that the checkbox for \"<i>Enable access to Azure Resource Manager for template deployment<\/i>\" is checked as shown below:\r\n<br \/><br \/>\r\n<img alt=\"Access Policies\" src=\"\/images\/1476819105580678a1cfc9f.png\" \/>\r\n<br \/> <br \/>\r\n\r\n    <\/li>\r\n\r\n<\/ol>\r\n\r\nWe are now all set with our Key Vault. Next, we will be using the secret we created to set the local Administrator user's password.\r\n\r\n### Using the Key Vault Secret in ARM Template ###\r\n\r\nLet us assume that you have a JSON ARM Template which deploys a VM. One of the parameters in this template is AdminPassword. You want to use the Key Vault Secret to provide the value for this parameter. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**First**, ensure that the parameter is declared as <i>securestring<\/i> as shown below:\r\n\r\n    \"adminPassword\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"securestring\",\r\n        \"metadata\": {\r\n            \"description\": \"Password for local admin account.\"\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n**Next**, we need to use the parameters file for this template. If you don't have one already create a new one. We can provide the reference to the Key Vault Secret as the value of admin user's password parameter in this file. General Syntax of providing reference is as shown follow:\r\n\r\n    \"adminPassword\": {\r\n      \"reference\": {\r\n        \"keyVault\": {\r\n          \"id\": \"Key Vault Id Here\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"secretName\": \"Name of the secret in Azure Key Vault\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNow the ID in the above Syntax can be provided as:\r\n\r\n*\/subscriptions\/{guid}\/resourceGroups\/{group-name}\/providers\/Microsoft.KeyVault\/vaults\/{vault-name}*. \r\n\r\nNote to replace the *{guid}* with actual GUID for the subscription (without the curly braces), replace *{group-name}* with the actual name of the resource group and *{vault-name}* with the actual name of the Key Vault.\r\n\r\nYou can also find the Resource ID for the Key Vault by navigating to it in the Azure Portal and then checking it's properties as shown below:\r\n\r\n![Key Vault Resource ID](\/images\/147682308858068830f2f8e.png)\r\n\r\nThe complete parameter file looks like below:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      \"$schema\": \"http:\/\/schema.management.azure.com\/schemas\/2015-01-01\/deploymentParameters.json#\",\r\n      \"contentVersion\": \"1.0.0.0\",\r\n      \"parameters\": {\r\n        \"OtherParameter\": {\r\n          \"value\": \"otherValue\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"adminPassword\": {\r\n          \"reference\": {\r\n            \"keyVault\": {\r\n              \"id\": \"\/subscriptions\/11111aaa-1a11-1a11-a1aa-1a1111a111a1\/resourceGroups\/TestRG101\/providers\/Microsoft.KeyVault\/vaults\/TestKeyVault101\"\r\n            },\r\n            \"secretName\": \"DefaultAdminPasswordSecret\"\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNext, deploy the template using PowerShell and pass this parameters file as explained here: [Deploying Template Using Azure PowerShell](\/post\/step-by-step-arm-templates-deploying-template-using-azure-powershell\/). \r\n\r\nExample PowerShell cmdlet to deploy will look like:\r\n\r\n    New-AzureRmResourceGroupDeployment -Name ExampleDeployment -ResourceGroupName TestResourceGroup01 -TemplateFile .\\TemplateFile.json -TemplateParameterFile .\\ParametersFile.json\r\n\r\nNow that you know how to use values from Key Vaults, you can make the automated deployment of resources more secure in your environment.",

This tool can be accessed by navigating to the below URL:\r\n\r\n[http:\/\/armviz.io\/](http:\/\/armviz.io\/)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Navigating ARMVIZ ###\r\n\r\nARMVIZ is a nice in-browser application to visualize all the components in a template. It also shows the dependencies between various components. Using this web application you can:\r\n\r\n - Either visualize your own developed template,\r\n - Or inspect existing templates on GitHub\r\n\r\nLet's take a quick tour of the interface:\r\n\r\n![ARMVIZ Interface](\/images\/14768067785806487ad77dd.png)\r\n\r\nI have numbered various elements of the interface in the above diagram. Let's quickly review these elements:\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\r\n    <li>\r\n              <b>Designer<\/b> - This is represented by an \"eye\" icon on the left bar. This should be selected by default. If you are in the editor mode then you can click this and the diagram will be shown in the middle portion of the screen.\r\n    <\/li>\r\n\r\n    <li>\r\n              <b>Editor<\/b> - This is represented by \"<\/>\" text for code on the left bar. Clicking on this will take you to the editor portion of the ARMVIZ tool. In this area, you can edit your template while still in the tool. You can add or remove components. You can even edit the components or add dependencies.\r\n    <\/li>\r\n\r\n     <li>\r\n              <b>Canvas area<\/b> - This is the main screen (the middle area) where the template is displayed.\r\n    <\/li>\r\n\r\n    <li>\r\n              <b>File Menu<\/b> - This is the main and simple menu in the whole web application in the top bar. It has two options:\r\n              <ol type=\"a\">\r\n                       <li>\r\n                             <b>Open Local Template<\/b> - You can open an ARM Template JSON from your local computer to visualize using this menu option.\r\n                       <\/li>\r\n                       <li>\r\n                             <b>Download Template<\/b> - You can download the current template by using this menu option.\r\n                       <\/li>\r\n              <\/ol>\r\n    <\/li>\r\n\r\n    <li>\r\n              <b>Quickstart ARM Templates<\/b> - This is the link to external library of Quickstart ARM Templates on GitHub. These starter templates can help you save a lot of time. Instead of starting from scratch you can use these templates to fasten the ARM Templates Development.\r\n    <\/li>\r\n\r\n<\/ol>\r\n\r\nThis is how the Editor portion of the tool looks like. Use this area to edit or update your template. \r\n**Note:** If there will be mistakes, such as missing parenthesis in your template, the designer will not show any diagram. \r\n\r\n![Editor Area](\/images\/147680732358064a9ba1310.png)\r\n\r\nYou can zoom into and zoom out of your template diagram by rolling the mouse wheel. You can also drag and reposition various elements. \r\nTake a screenshot once you have repositioned the elements as per your requirements and have zoomed into an appropriate level.\r\n\r\nBelow screenshot is taken from a much more complex template.\r\n\r\n![Complex ARM Template Diagram](\/images\/1476806791580648877fed3.png)\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, ARMVIZ can enable you to easily visualize your ARM Templates. It can empower you to generate diagrams for your documentation and to present to your team.",

You can have the OMS extension installed. And then you can onboard the VM to a specified workspace. \r\n\r\n### Prerequisites ###\r\n\r\nYou need already have an OMS workspace setup in your subscription. You need to have the following information about this OMS Workspace:\r\n\r\n 1. OMS workspace ID\r\n 2. OMS workspace Key\r\n\r\nYou may obtain the workspace ID and key by going to the Connected Sources tab in the Settings page in the OMS Portal or to the Direct Agent blade in the Azure portal.\r\n\r\nIn the Azure Portal go to the Log Analytics -> Click on the OMS Workspace you want to use. Click on the \"OMS Portal\" to navigate to the OMS Portal.\r\n\r\n![Link to OMS Portal](\/images\/14768464545806e3762d97c.png)\r\n\r\nIn the OMS portal, navigate to the Settings.\r\n\r\n![OMS Portal Settings](\/images\/14768422705806d31e60125.png)\r\n\r\nIn Settings, go to the Connected Sources -> Windows Servers. Note the Workspace ID and the Primary Key as shown below:\r\n\r\n![OMS Portal ID and Key](\/images\/14768422755806d323b2caa.png)\r\n\r\n### ARM Template Sections for OMS integration ###\r\n\r\nWithin the VM resource, you need to define the OMS extension as shown below:\r\n\r\n      \"resources\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"type\": \"extensions\",\r\n          \"name\": \"Microsoft.EnterpriseCloud.Monitoring\",\r\n          \"apiVersion\": \"[variables('apiVersion')]\",\r\n          \"location\": \"[resourceGroup().location]\",\r\n          \"dependsOn\": [\r\n            \"[concat('Microsoft.Compute\/virtualMachines\/', variables('vmName'))]\"\r\n          ],\r\n          \"properties\": {\r\n            \"publisher\": \"Microsoft.EnterpriseCloud.Monitoring\",\r\n            \"type\": \"MicrosoftMonitoringAgent\",\r\n            \"typeHandlerVersion\": \"1.0\",\r\n            \"autoUpgradeMinorVersion\": true,\r\n            \"settings\": {\r\n              \"workspaceId\": \"Your Workspace ID Here\"\r\n            },\r\n            \"protectedSettings\": {\r\n              \"workspaceKey\": \"Your Workspace Key Here\"\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n\r\nThe above configures the OMS on the VM. Note that you need the nested extension resource of type \"Microsoft.EnterpriseCloud.Monitoring\". \r\n\r\nAlso, note the Workspace Id and Key in the template section above. Enter the values as per your environment which we found in the Prerequisites section above. \r\n\r\n### Providing the Workspace ID and Workspace Key Dynamically ###\r\n\r\nYou can also provide the Workspace Id and the Workspace Key dynamically by only using the OMS Workspace name. Follow the below sample. Note the use of reference, listKeys, and resourceId helper functions.\r\n\r\n    \"settings\": {\r\n              \"workspaceId\": \"[reference(resourceId('Microsoft.OperationalInsights\/workspaces\/', parameters('workspaceName')), '2015-03-20').customerId]\"\r\n            },\r\n            \"protectedSettings\": {\r\n              \"workspaceKey\": \"[listKeys(resourceId('Microsoft.OperationalInsights\/workspaces\/', parameters('workspaceName')), '2015-03-20').primarySharedKey]\"\r\n            }\r\n\r\n**Reference:** You can check the complete quick starter template for OMS integration here: [GitHub Sample - Deployment of a Windows VM with OMS Extension](https:\/\/github.com\/Azure\/azure-quickstart-templates\/tree\/master\/201-oms-extension-windows-vm)",

This email is also a reminder from Microsoft that the RemoteApp is going away. We need to plan for the migration for the existing RemoteApps to other platforms.\r\n\r\n### What this means ###\r\nThis means various things to you. Most prominently:\r\n\r\n - Over the next year, the support for Remote App is going away\r\n - You need to plan and migrate the existing RemoteApp application to other platforms\r\n - New Purchases in the Azure portal for RemoteApp are no longer available\r\n\r\n### When is the service coming to Stop ###\r\n\r\nThe service will have support through **August 31st, 2017**. That's when this service will come to a stop. New service purchase was stopped effective October 1st, 2016.\r\n\r\n### What are my Options ###\r\n\r\nYou have various options for migration. The option being **recommended** by Microsoft is using \"**Citrix XenApp express**\". In fact, Microsoft is partnering up with Citrix on this. This service is not yet available and is currently under development. As this will be the native option in Azure this will be your best bet once it is announced. You can learn more about this solution here on Citrix site: [Citrix and Microsoft](https:\/\/www.citrix.com\/global-partners\/microsoft\/remote-app.html)\r\n\r\nThe second option is to use Remote Desktop Services (RDS) deployed on Azure IaaS. This means to set up the infrastructure yourself and then deploy and host the RDS solution on that infrastructure in Azure. You can know more about the steps here: [Host desktops and apps in Remote Desktop Services on Azure](https:\/\/technet.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows-server-docs\/compute\/remote-desktop-services\/host-desktops-and-apps-in-remote-desktop-services)\r\n\r\nAnother option is to use  hosted solutions from various 3rd party vendors. You can find such solution from various partners from the Azure marketplace. You can also read and get to know the complete list of these hosting partners here: [RDS - Partners for hosting desktops and apps](https:\/\/technet.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows-server-docs\/compute\/remote-desktop-services\/rds-hosting-partners)\r\n\r\n**In conclusion,** I will recommend to wait and look out for Citrix XenApp express solution. If you need new remote application solutions then you need to either deploy your own solution or use one of the hosted solutions by 3rd party vendors. You can read more about the official announcement here: [Application Remoting and the Cloud](https:\/\/blogs.technet.microsoft.com\/enterprisemobility\/2016\/08\/12\/application-remoting-and-the-cloud\/?WT.mc_id=azurebg_email_Trans_1218_No_Usage_Azure_RemoteApp)",

		"body": "**Index** of all blogs in this **Step by Step ARM Templates series** is located here: [Step by Step Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Templates - Index](\/post\/step-by-step-azure-resource-manager-arm-templates-index\/)\r\n\r\nIn Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates, you can define the variable once and then iterate\/loop over that definition and create multiple instances of that resource.\r\nThere are 3 special constructs in ARM templates to help you with this. \r\n\r\nThese **constructs** are:\r\n\r\n - **copy** - This is a property that is defined within the resource. This is the construct which when defined indicates that this resource needs to be looped over and created multiple times. It also specifies the number of times to iterate via \"count\" property.\r\n - **copyIndex()** - Used to access the current iteration value. Its value for the first iteration is **zero**. For the second iteration, its value is 1 and so on... You can pass it an integer (number) as a parameter. Whatever number you pass that will become the value for the first iteration and subsequent iterations. E.g. copyIndex(20) will compute to 20 in the first iteration, 21 in the second iteration and so on.\r\n - **length** - This is the method of arrays. It computes the number of elements in an array. It can be used to set the \"count\" property of \"copy\" construct.\r\n\r\n**Note:** Arrays are always **zero indexed**. What that means is that the first element of the array is indexed at 0, the second element of the array is indexed at 1, and so on...\r\n\r\n### 1. Simple Example ###\r\nLet us understand these constructs using an example.\r\n\r\n    \"parameters\": { \r\n      \"count\": { \r\n        \"type\": \"int\", \r\n        \"defaultValue\": 3 \r\n      } \r\n    }, \r\n    \"resources\": [ \r\n      { \r\n          \"name\": \"[concat('HarvestingClouds-', copyIndex(100))]\", \r\n          \"type\": \"Microsoft.Web\/sites\", \r\n          \"location\": \"Central US\", \r\n          \"apiVersion\": \"2015-08-01\",\r\n          \"copy\": { \r\n             \"name\": \"websitescopy\", \r\n             \"count\": \"[parameters('count')]\" \r\n          }, \r\n          \"properties\": {\r\n              \"serverFarmId\": \"hostingPlanName\"\r\n          }\r\n      } \r\n    ]\r\n\r\n The above example will **result** in creation of below 3 web apps in Azure:\r\n\r\n - HarvestingClouds-100\r\n - HarvestingClouds-101\r\n - HarvestingClouds-102\r\n\r\nNote the usage of \"copy\" property in the above code example:\r\n\r\n     \"copy\": { \r\n                 \"name\": \"websitescopy\", \r\n                 \"count\": \"[parameters('count')]\" \r\n              }\r\n\r\nAs you can notice above, the value of this property is another JSON object. This object has further two properties: \r\n\r\n - First is the name property, which provides the name to the looping construct. This can be any meaningful name. \r\n - The second property is the count, which specifies how many times this resource definition should be deployed. Note that the value is set to the parameter named \"count\". The name of the parameter can be anything but the value of the parameter has to be a number (i.e. an integer).\r\n\r\nNext, note how the name of the web application is constructed using the copyIndex() helper function.\r\n\r\n    \"name\": \"[concat('HarvestingClouds-', copyIndex(100))]\"\r\n\r\nThe above value uses two helper functions. First is the \"concat()\" which is concatenating (i.e. joining) two values. First value is the prefix string \"HarvestingClouds-\". Second parameter and the second helper function is `copyIndex(100)`. This specifies the current iteration value, which is offset with 100. So for the first iteration, the value will be 0+100 = 100, for the second iteration the value will be 1+100 = 101 and so on...\r\n\r\n\r\n###  2. Example with an Array ###\r\n\r\nLet's assume that you want to deploy multiple web apps for different purposes. You need one web app for Production, one for Staging or testing and one for Development. You want to name the web apps deployed with the purpose concatenated.\r\nThe below example uses an array to set the values for the web app name:\r\n\r\n    \"parameters\": { \r\n      \"purpose\": { \r\n         \"type\": \"array\", \r\n             \"defaultValue\": [ \r\n             \"Production\", \r\n             \"Staging\", \r\n             \"Development\" \r\n          ] \r\n      }\r\n    }, \r\n    \"resources\": [ \r\n      { \r\n          \"name\": \"[concat('HarvestingClouds-', parameters('purpose')[copyIndex()])]\", \r\n          \"type\": \"Microsoft.Web\/sites\", \r\n          \"location\": \"Central US\", \r\n          \"apiVersion\": \"2015-08-01\",\r\n          \"copy\": { \r\n             \"name\": \"websitescopy\", \r\n             \"count\": \"[length(parameters('purpose'))]\" \r\n          }, \r\n          \"properties\": {\r\n              \"serverFarmId\": \"hostingPlanName\"\r\n          } \r\n      } \r\n    ]\r\n\r\nThe **output** of the above sample will be 3 web apps deployed in Azure with following names:\r\n\r\n - HarvestingClouds-Production\r\n - HarvestingClouds-Staging\r\n - HarvestingClouds-Development\r\n\r\nNote in the above code sample that the parameter \"purpose\" is an array with 3 values i.e. Production, Staging, and Development. Then in the \"copy\" construct the count property is set using the length of this array as shown below. As there are 3 elements in the array, the value of count will be 3 and the resource will be deployed 3 times.\r\n\r\n    \"count\": \"[length(parameters('purpose'))]\" \r\n\r\nNext, the name of the web app is set using the copyIndex() and the array itself as shown below:\r\n\r\n    \"name\": \"[concat('HarvestingClouds-', parameters('purpose')[copyIndex()])]\"\r\n\r\nAs earlier, it uses concat helper function to add two strings. The first string is simple text i.e. \"HarvestingClouds-\", which becomes the prefix for the web app name. Second is finding out the value of the array based on the current iteration. For the first iteration, copyIndex() will compute to zero, therefore the second parameter becomes `parameters('purpose')[0]`. This will fetch the 0th element of the array which is Production. Similarly, for the second iteration, copyIndex() will compute to 1, therefore the second parameter becomes `parameters('purpose')[1]`. This will fetch the second element of the array (or element at index value 1) which is Staging, and so on...\r\n\r\n### 3. Depending upon resources being deployed by the copy Loop ###\r\n\r\nLet's assume you want to deploy a storage account. But you want to deploy it only after all the web apps are deployed by the loop. In this scenario, the dependsOn property of a resource is set to the name of the \"copy\" property of the resource, rather than the resource itself.\r\n\r\n        {\r\n            \"apiVersion\": \"2015-06-15\",\r\n            \"type\": \"Microsoft.Storage\/storageAccounts\",\r\n            \"name\": \"teststorage101\",\r\n            \"location\": \"[resourceGroup().location]\",\r\n            \"properties\": {\r\n                \"accountType\": \"Standard_LRS\"\r\n             }\r\n           \"dependsOn\": [\"websitescopy\"]\r\n        }\r\n\r\nNote above that the dependsOn property is set to the name property of the copy in the earlier web app example. This storage account will not be deployed until all 3 web apps are not deployed.\r\n\r\n### 4. Limitations ###\r\n\r\nThere are two limitations on the use of the copy to iterate and create multiple resource instances:\r\n\r\n 1. **Nested Resources** - You cannot use a copy loop for a nested resource. If you need to create multiple instances of a resource that you typically define as nested within another resource, you must instead create the resource as a top-level resource and define the relationship with the parent resource through the **type** and **name** properties.\r\n 2. **Looping Properties of a Resource** - You can only use copy on resource types, not on properties within a resource type. E.g. Creating multiple data disks within a VM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat is all there is to iterate and creating multiple resources from a single definition. When your templates will start becoming complex then these constructs\/helper functions will help you a lot. E.g. you may need to deploy multiple load balanced resources, then you can use the concepts defined in this post.\r\n\r\nYou can also refer the official documentation here: [copy, copyIndex, and length](https:\/\/azure.microsoft.com\/en-us\/documentation\/articles\/resource-group-create-multiple\/)",

In this blog we will see how to use Visual Studio (VS) to deploy the template without leaving VS.\r\n\r\nDeploying with Visual Studio is very simple, straightforward and very intuitive. Just follow the below steps.\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\r\n    <li>\r\nEither go to the Solution Explorer -> Right Click on the project and select \"Deploy -> New Deployment\" as shown below:<br \/>\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/147578624957f6b6090d5eb.png\" alt=\"New Deployment - Solution Explorer\" \/><br \/>\r\n\r\nOr you can go to the menu option Project -> Deploy -> New Deployment as shown below:<br \/>\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/147578624157f6b601b647b.png\" alt=\"New Deployment - Project Menu\" \/>\r\n\r\n<br \/>\r\nOnce you click on the \"New Deployment\", you will be presented with the below Dialog for the deployment.<br \/>\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/147578742957f6baa5bfb1c.png\" alt=\"New Deployment Dialog\" \/><br \/>\r\n\r\nIf you are not logged in then it will ask you to log into your Azure account. <br \/>\r\n\r\n    <\/li>\r\n\r\n    <li>\r\nIn the Dialog for \"Deploy to Resource Group\" select the Subscription by clicking on the first drop down.<br \/>\r\n    <\/li>\r\n\r\n    <li>\r\nNext click on the drop down for the Resource Group. You can either select an existing Resource Group or you can click on \"<Create New...>\" option to create a new resource group for the current deployment.\r\n<br \/>\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/147578768757f6bba7dd5ec.png\" alt=\"Resource Group creation\" \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIf you click on \"<Create New...>\" option to create a new Resource Group then you will be presented with an additional popup.\r\n<br \/>\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/147578794457f6bca893e66.png\" alt=\"Resource Group creation additional Popup\" \/><br \/>\r\nIn this additional popup, type the name for your new resoruce group and the location in Azure where this should be created. Click \"Create\" once done in the additional popup. <br \/><br \/>\r\n    <\/li>\r\n\r\n    <li>\r\nNext, we are going to provide the value for the parameters. Go ahead and click on the \"Edit Parameters...\" link in the \"Deploy to Resource Group\" dialog. This will open another popup to provide the parameters. <br \/>\r\nButton to edit parameters is shown below:<br \/>\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/147578820657f6bdae623f9.png\" alt=\"Edit Parameters\" \/> <br \/>\r\n\r\nAdditional dialog to provide parameters is shown below: <br \/>\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/147578821157f6bdb3ec989.png\" alt=\"Providing Parameters\" \/> <br \/>\r\n\r\nNote the following points in the parameters:\r\n<ol type=\"a\">\r\n<li>Corresponding to the string parameters, a text box is provided.<\/li>\r\n<li>For the secure string parameters like password, a secure password text box is provided.<\/li>\r\n<li>Corresponding to the parameters for which you have defined the \"Allowed Values\" in your template, a combo box (or drop Down) is provided with the \"default Value\" selected by default.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n Click Ok once done\r\n   <\/li>\r\n\r\n    <li>\r\nNext, click on the Deploy button to deploy the template to Azure.\r\n    <\/li>\r\n\r\n    <li>\r\nYou can check the results in the <b>Outputs<\/b> window in the Visual Studio.

You can use other newer versions as well.\r\n\r\n### Pre-Requisites ###\r\n\r\nYou need to have Azure SDK installed to get true power of Visual Studio with Azure integration. If you don't have it already, you can install the same from here: [Azure SDK Downloads](https:\/\/azure.microsoft.com\/en-us\/downloads\/)\r\n\r\n### Authoring First ARM Template in Visual Studio ###\r\n\r\nAuthoring with Visual Studio is very easy. \r\n\r\n<ol type=\"1\">\r\n<li>To get started just launch the Visual Studio from the Start menu.<\/li>\r\n<li>Next, Create a new Project of type \"Azure Resource Group\" by navigating to Templates -> Visual C# -> Cloud <br \/><br \/>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/images\/147576108957f653c1768fc.png\" alt=\"New Project\" \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\r\n<\/li>\r\n\r\n<li>\r\n    Next, you will be presented with a dialog to \"Select Azure Template\". If you want to author from scratch then choose a Blank Template. Else select one of the starter template. For this blog, we will be using \"Windows Virtual Machine\" Template.<br \/><br \/>\r\n    <img src=\"\/images\/147576828457f66fdc0f0e6.png\" alt=\"Selecting Azure Template\" \/>\r\n    <br \/>\r\n<\/li>\r\n\r\n<li>\r\n    Project is created with various folders and files. You can explore the project in the solution explorer in Visual Studio.<br \/><br \/>\r\n    <img src=\"\/images\/147576986357f6760758619.png\" alt=\"Solution Explorer\" \/>\r\n    <br \/>\r\n\r\nLet us see what these folders and files are:\r\n        <ol type=\"a\">\r\n            <li><b>Scripts<\/b>: The single PS1 file is to create a new Resource Group and deploy the ARM Template. It uses \"New-AzureRmResourceGroupDeployment\" PowerShell cmdlet to deploy the template. <\/li>\r\n            <li><b>Templates<\/b>: \"<i>WindowsVirtualMachine.json<\/i>\" is the main ARM Template file that we are interested in. Also, \"<i>WindowsVirtualMachine.parameters.json<\/i>\" is the parameters file for the ARM template.<\/li>\r\n            <li><b>Tools<\/b>: This folder contains the \"AzCopy.exe\" file to help you copy any artifacts to Azure.<\/li>\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n<\/li>\r\n\r\n<li>\r\n    Double click and open the \"<i>WindowsVirtualMachine.json<\/i>\" file to open it. You will be presented with a huge JSON file. Collapse the section by clicking the small \"-\" signs to the left of the file. Also notice the <b>JSON Outline<\/b> panel to the left. This is your biggest friend in Visual Studio when authoring ARM Templates.<br \/><br \/>\r\n    <img src=\"\/images\/147577487757f6899d297b5.png\" alt=\"\" \/>\r\n    <br \/>\r\nYou can immediately notice that key sections both in the template in the middle and in the JSON Oultine panel on the left (in the image above) are:\r\n               <ol type=\"a\">\r\n                   <li>parameters<\/li>\r\n                   <li>variables<\/li>\r\n                   <li>resources<\/li>\r\n               <\/ol>\r\nYou can click on any of the elements in the left JSON Outline panel and the same section will be highlighted in the center, in the JSON template file.\r\n    <br \/>\r\n\r\n<\/li>\r\n\r\n<li>\r\n    Next, let us look at JSON Outline panel and check how it can provide us more information and help us in authoring templates.<br \/><br \/>\r\n    <img src=\"\/images\/147578115457f6a2226c2be.png\" alt=\"JSON Outline Panel\" \/>\r\n    <br \/>\r\n    You can see that the panel provides a special icon for each type of the resource. In our current template the various resources listed are:\r\n    <ol type=\"a\">\r\n        <li>StorageAccount<\/li>\r\n        <li>PublicIPAddress<\/li>\r\n        <li>VirtualNetwork<\/li>\r\n        <li>NetworkInterface<\/li>\r\n        <li>VirtualMachine<\/li>\r\n    <\/ol>\r\n\r\nClick on each of the resources and inspect how their JSON structure looks and differs. You will immediately notice that the major difference in each of these resources is in their <b>Type<\/b> and <b>Properties<\/b>.\r\n\r\n<h3>Adding New Resource<\/h3> \r\nLet's assume you want to add a new resource to this template. You have 2 ways to achieve the same:\r\n    <ol>\r\n    <li><b>Method 1<\/b> - Create a new resource by modifying and adding the JSON for the new resource in the template.<\/li>\r\n    <li><b>Method 2<\/b> - Let Visual Studio add the resource for you. Right click anywhere in the resources area of the JSON Outline Panel or the small \"+\" box at the top left of the panel (as shown in the image above) and VS will give you a new popup to add the resource from pre-defined resources as shown below.<\/li>\r\n    <\/ol>\r\n    <img src=\"\/images\/147578170157f6a4457bae0.png\" alt=\"Add Resource\" \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOnce you click Add the JSON for resource will be added to the template and the corresponding new element will appear in the JSON Outline Panel.\r\n<br \/>\r\n\r\n<h3>Deleting a Resource<\/h3> <br \/>\r\nIf you need to delete a resource, simply right click on that resource in the JSON outline panel on the left and then select \"Delete Resource\".\r\n<br \/>\r\n\r\n<h3>Using Intellisense<\/h3>     \r\nThe last thing to notice is the use of <b>Intellisense<\/b> in Visual Studio which helps you as you are editing the templates.<br \/><br \/>\r\n    <img src=\"\/images\/147578465457f6afce4debb.png\" alt=\"Intellisense\" \/>\r\n    <br \/>\r\n     When you type quotes the closing quotes are automatically provided. Also, as you can see in the above image the various valid values, that can come there are also shown along with small tooltip about the data type. If the Intellisense doesn't come up automatically, then press Ctrl + Space to get Intellisense.\r\n<\/li>\r\n\r\n<\/ol>\r\n\r\nIn the end, the Visual Studio makes authoring ARM templates much more manageable and easy for you.\r\n\r\nIn the next blog, we will see how to use Visual Studio to Deploy the templates.\r\n",

This additional file is what we will be referring to as **Parameters File**.\r\n\r\nThe only restriction on a parameters file is that the size of the parameter file cannot be more than 64 KB.\r\n\r\nParameters file follows a similar structure to the ARM Template. They are very simple as compared to the ARM template. In all they have 3 sections as explained below:\r\n\r\n 1. **$schema** - Required Object - Location of the JSON schema file that describes the version of the template language.\r\n 2. **contentVersion** - Required Object - Version of the template (such as 1.2.0.20). When deploying resources using the template, this value can be used to make sure that the right template is being used.\r\n 3. **parameters** - Required Object - This is a JSON object which contains various objects as it's members. Each object within the \"parameters\" object represent a value for a parameter corresponding to your ARM template.\r\n\r\nLet's check how the parameters file will look like for the ARM template we have built earlier for deploying Storage Account and a Virtual Network.\r\n\r\n    {\r\n        \"$schema\": \"https:\/\/schema.management.azure.com\/schemas\/2015-01-01\/deploymentParameters.json#\",\r\n        \"contentVersion\": \"1.0.0.0\",\r\n        \"parameters\": {\r\n            \"vhdStorageName\": {\r\n                \"value\": \"harvestingstorage101\"\r\n            },\r\n            \"virtualNetworkName\": {\r\n                \"value\": \"testvNet101\"\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNote that the only 2 parameter values are provided.

Now that you have a fully functional ARM template we want to deploy this template to Azure.\r\n\r\nThere are various options to deploy a template to Azure. We already saw in the last blog [How to deploy template using **Azure Portal**](\/post\/step-by-step-arm-templates-deploying-template-using-azure-portal\/). Now we will look at **Azure PowerShell** as more programmatic and automated way to deploy the template.\r\n\r\n## Pre-requisites ##\r\n\r\nThings you should know before deployment\r\n\r\n 1. **Azure PowerShell** - This should be installed on the machine from where the Steps will be followed. If you don't have this then use this link to get it: [Get Azure PowerShell](https:\/\/azure.microsoft.com\/en-us\/documentation\/articles\/powershell-install-configure\/)\r\n 2. **Azure Subscription** - where you want to deploy your template\r\n 3. **Resource Group** - This is the resource group in Azure where you will be deploying your template. You can create a new resource group (for the resources that will be deployed by the template) or use an existing one.\r\n 4. **Parameters** - Value of the input parameters to the template should be known to you for the deployment. Follow all your naming conventions when defining the parameters for deployments of resources in Azure. \r\n 5. **Internet Connectivity** - This should be present on the machine from where the Steps will be followed for connectivity to Azure\r\n\r\n## Steps for Deployment ##\r\n\r\n- First, launch a PowerShell window as an Administrator\r\n- Then, log into the Azure account. \r\n\r\nRun the below cmdlet to log into Azure:\r\n\r\n    Add-AzureRmAccount\r\n\r\n- Select appropriate Azure Subscription\r\n\r\nYou have two choices here. You can either use below cmdlet to use Subscription ID\r\n\r\n    Set-AzureRmContext -SubscriptionID <YourSubscriptionId>\r\n\r\nOr you can use the Subscription name with the below cmdlet:\r\n\r\n    Select-AzureRmSubscription -SubscriptionName \"<Your Subscription Name>\"\r\n\r\n- Next, if you already have a resource group to which you want to deploy the template then skip this step. Else create a new resource group. A resource in Azure ARM architecture can only exist in a resource group. \r\n\r\nUse below cmdlet to create a new Resource Group:\r\n\r\n    New-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name TestResourceGroup01 -Location \"Central US\"\r\n\r\n- Before deploying the Resource Template to Azure, you should Test it. This step is optional but highly recommended.\r\n\r\nUse the below cmdlet to test and validate your template:\r\n\r\n    Test-AzureRmResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName TestResourceGroup01 -TemplateFile <PathToJsonTemplate>\r\n\r\n- Now comes the last step i.e. to deploy the template. You have two options when deploying the template. You can either deploy a template without any parameters (if none are required) or you need to specify the parameters. Let's check both these options next.\r\n\r\n### Deploying Template which doesn't need Parameters ###\r\n\r\nYou can deploy such template using `New-AzureRmResourceGroupDeployment` cmdlet. \r\nIf the template file is on a local directory then use the below cmdlet:\r\n\r\n    New-AzureRmResourceGroupDeployment -Name ExampleDeployment -ResourceGroupName TestResourceGroup01 -TemplateFile <PathToTemplate>\r\n\r\nIf the template file is uploaded to some hosted location and is accessible via a link, then use the below cmdlet to deploy the template:\r\n\r\n    New-AzureRmResourceGroupDeployment -Name ExampleDeployment -ResourceGroupName TestResourceGroup01 -TemplateUri <LinkToTemplate>\r\n\r\n### Deploying Template with Parameters ###\r\n\r\nDeploying of the template is exactly similar as the previous section. You use the same cmdlet. To specify the parameter, you have 4 options. Use the below cmdlets for the option you want to use.\r\n\r\n**Option 1** - Using Inline Parameter\r\n\r\n    New-AzureRmResourceGroupDeployment -Name ExampleDeployment -ResourceGroupName TestResourceGroup01 -TemplateFile <PathToTemplate> -myParameterName \"parameterValue\" -secondParameterName \"secondParameterValue\"\r\n\r\n**Option 2** - Using Parameter Object\r\n\r\n    $parameters = @{\"<ParameterName>\"=\"<Parameter Value>\"}\r\n    New-AzureRmResourceGroupDeployment -Name ExampleDeployment -ResourceGroupName TestResourceGroup01 -TemplateFile <PathToTemplate> -TemplateParameterObject $parameters\r\n\r\n**Option 3** - Using Parameter file which is in local environment\r\n\r\n    New-AzureRmResourceGroupDeployment -Name ExampleDeployment -ResourceGroupName TestResourceGroup01 -TemplateFile <PathToTemplate> -TemplateParameterFile <PathToParameterFile>\r\n\r\n**Option 4** - Using Parameter file which is located externally and can be referenced via Link\r\n\r\n    New-AzureRmResourceGroupDeployment -Name ExampleDeployment -ResourceGroupName TestResourceGroup01 -TemplateUri <LinkToTemplate> -TemplateParameterUri <LinkToParameterFile>\r\n\r\n### Key Gotchas ###\r\n\r\n 1. If you provide values for a parameter in both the local parameter file and inline, the inline value takes precedence.\r\n 2. You cannot use inline parameters with an external parameter file. All inline parameters are ignored when you specify \"TemplateParameterUri\" parameter.\r\n 3. As a best practice, do not store sensitive infomation in the parameters file e.g. Local admin password. Instead either provide these dynamically using inline parameters. Or store them using the Azure Key vault and then reference the key vault in your parameters file.\r\n\r\nYou can find more details about these cmdlets here: [Deploy resources with Resource Manager templates and Azure PowerShell](https:\/\/azure.microsoft.com\/en-us\/documentation\/articles\/resource-group-template-deploy\/#deploy-with-powershell)\r\n\r\nIn the next blog, we will see how to create a Parameters File for providing parameters dynamically to the template.",

Now that you have a fully functional ARM template we want to deploy this template to Azure.\r\n\r\nThere are various options to deploy a template to Azure. Using Azure portal is by far the easiest and most intuitive option for the deployment. Follow the steps in this blog to deploy your template to Azure.\r\n\r\n## Pre-requisites ##\r\n\r\nThings you should know before deployment\r\n\r\n 1. **Azure Subscription** - where you want to deploy your template\r\n 2. **Resource Group** - This is the resource group in Azure where you will be deploying your template.

Follow all your naming conventions when defining the parameters for deployments of resources in Azure.\r\n\r\n## Steps for Deployment ##\r\n\r\n 1. First, log into the Azure Portal.\r\n 2. Next, go to \"New\" and type \"Template deployment\" in the search box and hit enter.\r\n\r\n    ![New Deployment](\/images\/147559616157f3cf81381da.png)\r\n\r\n 3. Next, click on the **Template Deployment** and then click on \"Create\"\r\n\r\n    ![Create Deployment](\/images\/147559654057f3d0fc1bf5c.png)\r\n\r\n 4. Now click on the \"**Template (Edit Template)**\". It will open a panel to paste your template. Delete whatever is auto populated in the template area. Copy your whole json template and paste it here. Note that the left section in the new panel will update to show you what parameters, variables, and resources you have in the template. Click on \"Save\" once done.\r\n\r\n    ![Editing Template](\/images\/147559697957f3d2b32ff67.png)\r\n\r\n 5. Next, click on the \"**Parameters (Edit Parameters)**\" on the left side. The parameters will be automatically picked from the template. The parameters for which the default value is provided will be automatically populated. Rest you will have to provide the inputs. Click Ok once done.\r\n\r\n    ![Providing Parameters](\/images\/147559719657f3d38c652e3.png)\r\n\r\n 6. Next, you have the option to select the **Resource Group**. You can either create a new resource group (for all the resources that will be deployed via the template) or you can use and existing resource group.\r\n\r\n    ![Resource Group Selection](\/images\/147559727457f3d3da45879.png)\r\n\r\n 7. The last option is to click on the \"**Legal Terms**\" and read through the terms. If you agree then click on the \"Purchase\" button. \r\n\r\n   ![Legal Terms](\/images\/147559762057f3d534eae90.png)\r\n\r\n 8. Finally, click on the **Create** to submit the deployment. \r\n\r\nYou can monitor the job performing the deployments and progress of the same. After some time the deployment will finish successfully and you can view the resources in the resource group you selected.",

		"body": "**Index** of all blogs in this **Step by Step ARM Templates series** is located here: [Step by Step Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Templates - Index](\/post\/step-by-step-azure-resource-manager-arm-templates-index\/)\r\n\r\nIn this blog post, we will use the knowledge learned in previous blogs and will build a basic ARM template. \r\nIf you haven't checked previous blog posts then have a quick read of your preferred topics here: [Step by Step Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Templates - Index](\/post\/step-by-step-azure-resource-manager-arm-templates-index\/)\r\n\r\nTo follow this blog, you can use any text editor which can provide JSON syntax highlighting. We will be looking at using Visual Studio to author ARM templates in a future blog post. Visual Studio can provide JSON outlining and is a very powerful tool for authoring ARM templates.\r\n\r\nLet us assume that you want to deploy a storage account and build a virtual network in Azure. You want to automate the process and need to repeat the process in various environments. ARM templates fit the bill for the solution of this problem.\r\n\r\nIn the next few sections, we will build each section of the template and then at the end will check the complete template.\r\n\r\n### 1. Template Header ###\r\n\r\nThis section is very basic and contains just the schema and the content version. You can use the content version to manage the development versions of the template as you make changes to your templates in the future.\r\n\r\n    \"$schema\": \"https:\/\/schema.management.azure.com\/schemas\/2015-01-01\/deploymentTemplate.json#\",\r\n    \"contentVersion\": \"1.0.0.0\",\r\n\r\n### 2. Parameters ###\r\n\r\nHere we define all the inputs we need from the end users. We provide default values for those parameters for which we know what the most common values will be based on our environment. For the current template we define two parameters:\r\n\r\n - **vhdStorageName** - This is the name of the storage account in Azure which will be created by the deployment of this template.\r\n - **virtualNetworkName** - This is the name of the Virtual Network which will be created by the deployment of this template.\r\n\r\nAs a best practice, provide the metadata, describing what each parameter is for. Also, note that we have used pascal casing to name the parameters with very descriptive names.\r\n\r\n    \"parameters\": {\r\n        \"vhdStorageName\": {\r\n            \"type\": \"string\",\r\n            \"minLength\": 1,\r\n            \"defaultValue\": \"mystorage101\",\r\n            \"metadata\": {\r\n                \"description\": \"Name of the Storage Account.\"\r\n            }\r\n        },\r\n        \"virtualNetworkName\": {\r\n            \"type\": \"string\",\r\n            \"metadata\": {\r\n                \"description\": \"Name of the virtual network.\"\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    },\r\n\r\n### 3. Variables ###\r\n\r\nNext, we add some variables for the values which will be reused later in the template in the resources section. We create variables for all those reusable values for which we know what their value at deployment will be. We define 4 variables in this template:\r\n\r\n - **addressPrefix** - Address prefix for the Virtual Network \r\n - **subnetName** - Subnet name which will be created under the virtual network\r\n - **subnetPrefix** - Subnet prefix for the subnet, which will be created under the virtual network\r\n - **vhdStorageType** - Type of the storage account. Here we used Standard locally redundant storage (LRS)\r\n\r\nVariables section look as below:\r\n\r\n    \"variables\": {\r\n        \"addressPrefix\": \"10.0.0.0\/16\",\r\n        \"subnetName\": \"Subnet\",\r\n        \"subnetPrefix\": \"10.0.0.0\/24\",\r\n        \"vhdStorageType\": \"Standard_LRS\"\r\n    },\r\n\r\n### 4. Resources ###\r\n\r\nNow comes the last and main section i.e. Resources. Here we define both the resources for our template:\r\n\r\n - Storage Account\r\n - Virtual Network\r\n\r\nLet us look at each of these resources one by one.\r\n\r\n**A. Storage Account Resource**\r\n\r\nThis resource has below properties (or key-value pairs):\r\n\r\n 1. **Type** - Type of the resource is set to Microsoft.Storage\/storageAccounts. This is what tells the Azure that the current resource is a Storage Account\r\n 2. **Name** - This defines the name of the storage account to be deployed based on the parameter to the template\r\n 3. **API Version** - this is the standard version for the REST API in Azure\r\n 4. **Location** - This is the Azure location. The location is found dynamically based on the location of the resource group to which this template will be deployed.\r\n 5. **tags** - only one tag is defined for the display name. You should have more tags in case of a production ready template\r\n 6. **properties** - This is where you tell Azure what kind of storage account you need. Here the account type is set using the value of the variable vhdStorageType.\r\n\r\n**B. Virtual Network Resource**\r\n\r\nThis resource has below properties (or key-value pairs):\r\n\r\n 1. **Type** - Type of the resource is set to Microsoft.Network\/virtualNetworks. This is what tells the Azure that the current resource is a Virtual Network\r\n 2. **Name** - This defines the name of the virtual network to be deployed based on the parameter to the template\r\n 3. **API Version** - this is the standard version for the REST API in Azure\r\n 4. **Location** - This is the Azure location. The location is found dynamically based on the location of the resource group to which this template will be deployed.\r\n 5. **tags** - only one tag is defined for the display name. You should have more tags in case of a production ready template\r\n 6. **properties** - This is where you define the address space for the virtual network. You also define the subnet under the virtual network here.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe resources section look like below:\r\n\r\n    \"resources\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"type\": \"Microsoft.Storage\/storageAccounts\",\r\n            \"name\": \"[parameters('vhdStorageName')]\",\r\n            \"apiVersion\": \"2015-06-15\",\r\n            \"location\": \"[resourceGroup().location]\",\r\n            \"tags\": {\r\n                \"displayName\": \"StorageAccount\"\r\n            },\r\n            \"properties\": {\r\n                \"accountType\": \"[variables('vhdStorageType')]\"\r\n            }\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"apiVersion\": \"2015-06-15\",\r\n            \"type\": \"Microsoft.Network\/virtualNetworks\",\r\n            \"name\": \"[parameters('virtualNetworkName')]\",\r\n            \"location\": \"[resourceGroup().location]\",\r\n            \"tags\": {\r\n                \"displayName\": \"VirtualNetwork\"\r\n            },\r\n            \"properties\": {\r\n                \"addressSpace\": {\r\n                    \"addressPrefixes\": [\r\n                        \"[variables('addressPrefix')]\"\r\n                    ]\r\n                },\r\n                \"subnets\": [\r\n                    {\r\n                        \"name\": \"[variables('subnetName')]\",\r\n                        \"properties\": {\r\n                            \"addressPrefix\": \"[variables('subnetPrefix')]\"\r\n                        }\r\n                    }\r\n                ]\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n\r\n### Complete Template ###\r\n\r\nHere is the complete template build from all the sections discussed above. You can copy and use this template for testing and working along with next deployment posts.\r\n\r\n    {\r\n        \"$schema\": \"https:\/\/schema.management.azure.com\/schemas\/2015-01-01\/deploymentTemplate.json#\",\r\n        \"contentVersion\": \"1.0.0.0\",\r\n        \"parameters\": {\r\n            \"vhdStorageName\": {\r\n                \"type\": \"string\",\r\n                \"minLength\": 1,\r\n                \"defaultValue\": \"mystorage101\",\r\n                \"metadata\": {\r\n                    \"description\": \"Name of the Storage Account.\"\r\n                }\r\n            },\r\n            \"virtualNetworkName\": {\r\n                \"type\": \"string\",\r\n                \"metadata\": {\r\n                    \"description\": \"Name of the virtual network.\"\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        },\r\n        \"variables\": {\r\n            \"addressPrefix\": \"10.0.0.0\/16\",\r\n            \"subnetName\": \"Subnet\",\r\n            \"subnetPrefix\": \"10.0.0.0\/24\",\r\n            \"vhdStorageType\": \"Standard_LRS\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"resources\": [\r\n            {\r\n                \"type\": \"Microsoft.Storage\/storageAccounts\",\r\n                \"name\": \"[parameters('vhdStorageName')]\",\r\n                \"apiVersion\": \"2015-06-15\",\r\n                \"location\": \"[resourceGroup().location]\",\r\n                \"tags\": {\r\n                    \"displayName\": \"StorageAccount\"\r\n                },\r\n                \"properties\": {\r\n                    \"accountType\": \"[variables('vhdStorageType')]\"\r\n                }\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                \"apiVersion\": \"2015-06-15\",\r\n                \"type\": \"Microsoft.Network\/virtualNetworks\",\r\n                \"name\": \"[parameters('virtualNetworkName')]\",\r\n                \"location\": \"[resourceGroup().location]\",\r\n                \"tags\": {\r\n                    \"displayName\": \"VirtualNetwork\"\r\n                },\r\n                \"properties\": {\r\n                    \"addressSpace\": {\r\n                        \"addressPrefixes\": [\r\n                            \"[variables('addressPrefix')]\"\r\n                        ]\r\n                    },\r\n                    \"subnets\": [\r\n                        {\r\n                            \"name\": \"[variables('subnetName')]\",\r\n                            \"properties\": {\r\n                                \"addressPrefix\": \"[variables('subnetPrefix')]\"\r\n                            }\r\n                        }\r\n                    ]\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        ]\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIn the next blog, we will learn how to deploy this template.\r\n",

These constructs reduce the hard coded values in your templates. You can use the information from this blog to make your existing templates more dynamic and start writing new templates with a much generic approach.\r\n\r\nLet's look at the most important helper functions and their practical usage one by one. \r\n\r\n### 1. Resource Id - Resource Function ###\r\n\r\nYou use this function to determine the ID of a resource. This is only used when the resource (whose ID is needed) is not being deployed in the current template and it already exists in Azure.\r\n\r\nThe generic syntax to use this is:\r\n\r\n    resourceId ([subscriptionId], [resourceGroupName], resourceType, resourceName1, [resourceName2]...)\r\n\r\nOnly required parameters of this helper function are resourceType and resourceName1.\r\n\r\nThese parameters are as follows:\r\n\r\n - subscription ID - This is only needed if you want to refer a different subscription. Default value is the current subscription\r\n - resource Group Name - Name of the resource group where the resource exists. Default is the current resource group, in which you are deploying the template\r\n - resource Type - Type of resource including resource provider namespace\r\n - resource Name 1  - Name of the resource\r\n - resource Name 2  - Next resource name segment if resource is nested. E.g. a VM Extension\r\n\r\n \r\n**Example**\r\n\r\n    \"vnetId1\": \"[resourceId('AE06-Mgmt-RG','Microsoft.Network\/virtualNetworks', parameters('virtualNetworkName'))]\",\r\n    \"vnetId2\": \"[resourceId('Microsoft.Network\/virtualNetworks', variables('virtualNetworkName'))]\"\r\n\r\nThe above example shows two ways of using the resource ID helper function to determine the Id of a virtual network. First one uses the resource group, resource type and resource name. Second example uses only the resource Type and resource name. Second example assumes the resource group to be same as the template being deployed to.\r\n\r\n### 2. Resource Group - Resource Function ###\r\n\r\nThis helper function returns an object that represents the current resource group to which the template is being deployed.\r\n\r\nThe generic syntax to use this is:\r\n\r\n    resourceGroup()\r\n\r\nNo parameters are needed in this helper function.\r\n\r\n**Example**\r\n\r\n    \"vhdStorageName\": \"[concat('vhdstorage', uniqueString(resourceGroup().id))]\",\r\n     \"storageAccountResourceGroup\": \"[resourcegroup().name]\",\r\n     \"location\": \"[resourceGroup().location]\"\r\n\r\nThe above example shows 3 uses of the resource group helper functions. First one uses the ID of the resource group, second uses the name property and third uses the location for the current resource group.\r\n\r\n### 3. Subscription - Resource Function ###\r\n\r\nThe generic syntax to use this is:\r\n\r\n    subscription()\r\n\r\nNo parameters are needed in this helper function.\r\n \r\n**Example**\r\n\r\n    \"subscriptionId\": \"[subscription().subscriptionId]\"\r\n\r\nThe above example is straightforward. It fetches the subscription Id of the current subscription.\r\n\r\n### 4. Concat - String Function ###\r\n\r\nThis function is used to concatinate (i.e. combine) two or more values.\r\n\r\nThe generic syntax to use this is:\r\n\r\n    concat (array1, array2, array3, ...)\r\n\r\nAt least 1 array is needed for concat to work. \r\n \r\n**Example**\r\n\r\n    \"subnetRef\": \"[concat(variables('vNetId'), '\/subnets\/', variables('subnetName'))]\"\r\n\r\nThe above example combines (or concatinates) 3 text values. First value is the value of variable vNetId. Second value is a string \"\/subnets\/\". Third value is the value of the variable subnet Name.\r\n\r\nThese are the most common Helper functions that you will use in 80%-90% of the templates. \r\n\r\nTo check the complete list of Helper Functions, check this official link: [Azure Resource Manager template functions](https:\/\/azure.microsoft.com\/en-us\/documentation\/articles\/resource-group-template-functions\/#resource-functions)\r\n",

This can output any Ids or connection strings based on the deployed resources. \r\n\r\nThis is a single JSON object with various output objects (just like Parameters. The overall JSON structure looks like below:\r\n\r\n    \"outputs\": { \r\n        \"output1\" : {\r\n                         \"type\":\"string\",\r\n                         \"value\": \"value1\"\r\n          },\r\n        \"output2\" : {\r\n                         \"type\":\"string\",\r\n                         \"value\": \"value2\"\r\n          },\r\n    }\r\n\r\nEach output object has 2 properties:\r\n\r\n 1.

[Outputs](..\/step-by-step-arm-templates-what-is-in-an-arm-template-understanding-components-5-outputs\/)\r\n\r\n## Resources ##\r\n\r\nThis is the major section of the whole ARM template. This is where you define what resources should be deployed in Azure. You also define dependencies between resources in this section. \r\n\r\nThe resources section consist of an array of JSON Objects as shown below:\r\n\r\n    \"resources\": [\r\n            { },\r\n            { },\r\n    ]\r\n\r\nEach object in the array (represented via curly braces) is an Azure resource. You can deploy multiple resources in a single ARM template. E.g. You can deploy a new Storage Account, new Virtual Network and three Virtual Machines in that virtual network within a single template.\r\nWithin the object, various properties (and nested properties) are used to provide the configurations of each resource. \r\n\r\n### Elements ###\r\n\r\nDifferent elements in a single resource object can be one of the following:\r\n\r\n 1. **apiVersion** - ***Required*** - Version of the API. e.g. \"2015-06-15\"\r\n 2. **type** - ***Required*** - Type of the resource. This value is a combination of the namespace of the resource provider and the resource type that the resource provider supports. e.g. Azure Storage Account will have type as \"Microsoft.Storage\/storageAccounts\".\r\n 3. **name** - ***Required*** - Name of the resource. The name must follow URI component restrictions and also the Azure naming restrictions if any. E.g. Storage account name can only be in small letters and has to be unique.\r\n 4. **location** - Optional - Use supported geo-locations of the provided resource without any spaces. Or use the resource group's location dynamically.\r\n 5. **tags** - Optional - Tags that are associated with the resource.\r\n 6. **dependsOn** - Optional - Other resources in the same template, that the current resource being defined depends on. The dependencies between resources are evaluated and resources are deployed in their dependent order. When resources are not dependent on each other, they are attempted to be deployed in parallel. The value can be a comma-separated list of resource names or resource unique identifiers.\r\n 7. **properties** - Optional - Resource specific configuration settings. E.g. Account type property for a storage account name.\r\n 8. **resources** - Optional - Child resources that depend on the resource being defined. E.g. Extension resources for a Virtual Machine resource.\r\n\r\n### Examples ###\r\n\r\nLet's look at two examples. First, we will take a simple resource example to deploy a storage account in Azure:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n                \"type\": \"Microsoft.Storage\/storageAccounts\",\r\n                \"name\": \"[variables('vhdStorageName')]\",\r\n                \"apiVersion\": \"2015-06-15\",\r\n                \"location\": \"[resourceGroup().location]\",\r\n                \"tags\": {\r\n                    \"displayName\": \"StorageAccount\",\r\n                    \"department\" : \"Finance\",\r\n                    \"application\" : \"database\"\r\n                },\r\n                \"properties\": {\r\n                    \"accountType\": \"[variables('vhdStorageType')]\"\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n\r\nAbove example will deploy a storage account with the name from \"vhdStorageName\" variable. It will apply 3 tags to the resource after deployment. It will use the account type (i.e. standard or premium) based on the value of the \"vhdStorageType\" variable. If you want to deploy 2 or more similar storage accounts, then just copy and paste the json for the resource, separated by comma. It will become another object in the Resources array.\r\n\r\nNow let's look at a complex and larger example of deploying a single virtual machine with one extension for Diagnostics.\r\n\r\n        {\r\n            \"apiVersion\": \"2015-06-15\",\r\n            \"type\": \"Microsoft.Compute\/virtualMachines\",\r\n            \"name\": \"[variables('vmName')]\",\r\n            \"location\": \"[resourceGroup().location]\",\r\n            \"tags\": {\r\n                \"displayName\": \"VirtualMachine\"\r\n            },\r\n            \"dependsOn\": [\r\n                \"[concat('Microsoft.Storage\/storageAccounts\/', variables('vhdStorageName'))]\",\r\n                \"[concat('Microsoft.Network\/networkInterfaces\/', variables('nicName'))]\"\r\n            ],\r\n            \"properties\": {\r\n                \"hardwareProfile\": {\r\n                    \"vmSize\": \"[variables('vmSize')]\"\r\n                },\r\n                \"osProfile\": {\r\n                    \"computerName\": \"[variables('vmName')]\",\r\n                    \"adminUsername\": \"[parameters('adminUsername')]\",\r\n                    \"adminPassword\": \"[parameters('adminPassword')]\"\r\n                },\r\n                \"storageProfile\": {\r\n                    \"imageReference\": {\r\n                        \"publisher\": \"[variables('imagePublisher')]\",\r\n                        \"offer\": \"[variables('imageOffer')]\",\r\n                        \"sku\": \"[parameters('windowsOSVersion')]\",\r\n                        \"version\": \"latest\"\r\n                    },\r\n                    \"osDisk\": {\r\n                        \"name\": \"osdisk\",\r\n                        \"vhd\": {\r\n                            \"uri\": \"[concat('http:\/\/', variables('vhdStorageName'), '.blob.core.windows.net\/', variables('vhdStorageContainerName'), '\/', variables('OSDiskName'), '.vhd')]\"\r\n                        },\r\n                        \"caching\": \"ReadWrite\",\r\n                        \"createOption\": \"FromImage\"\r\n                    }\r\n                },\r\n                \"networkProfile\": {\r\n                    \"networkInterfaces\": [\r\n                        {\r\n                            \"id\": \"[resourceId('Microsoft.Network\/networkInterfaces', variables('nicName'))]\"\r\n                        }\r\n                    ]\r\n                },\r\n                \"diagnosticsProfile\": {\r\n                    \"bootDiagnostics\": {\r\n                        \"enabled\": true,\r\n                        \"storageUri\": \"[concat('http:\/\/', variables('diagnosticsStorageAccountName'), '.blob.core.windows.net')]\"\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n            },\r\n            \"resources\": [\r\n                {\r\n                    \"type\": \"extensions\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"Microsoft.Insights.VMDiagnosticsSettings\",\r\n                    \"apiVersion\": \"2015-06-15\",\r\n                    \"location\": \"[resourceGroup().location]\",\r\n                    \"tags\": {\r\n                        \"displayName\": \"AzureDiagnostics\"\r\n                    },\r\n                    \"dependsOn\": [\r\n                        \"[concat('Microsoft.Compute\/virtualMachines\/', variables('vmName'))]\"\r\n                    ],\r\n                    \"properties\": {\r\n                        \"publisher\": \"Microsoft.Azure.Diagnostics\",\r\n                        \"type\": \"IaaSDiagnostics\",\r\n                        \"typeHandlerVersion\": \"1.5\",\r\n                        \"autoUpgradeMinorVersion\": true,\r\n                        \"settings\": {\r\n                            \"xmlCfg\": \"[base64(concat(variables('wadcfgxstart'), variables('wadmetricsresourceid'), variables('wadcfgxend')))]\",\r\n                            \"storageAccount\": \"[variables('diagnosticsStorageAccountName')]\"\r\n                        },\r\n                        \"protectedSettings\": {\r\n                            \"storageAccountName\": \"[variables('diagnosticsStorageAccountName')]\",\r\n                            \"storageAccountKey\": \"[listkeys(variables('accountid'), '2015-06-15').key1]\",\r\n                            \"storageAccountEndPoint\": \"https:\/\/core.windows.net\"\r\n                        }\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n            ]\r\n        }\r\n\r\nNote that the above code snippet defines a single virtual machine. Let us decode various sections of this complex resource:\r\n\r\n - It begins with simple properties like apiVersion, type, name, location and tags as discussed in the previous example. These are straightforward and thus values are provided to these attributes.\r\n - Next is the **dependsOn** section. This defines the dependency between resources. In the above example, the virtual machine resource is dependent on the storage account and a network interface, which are also defined in the template. These 2 resources will be created before the virtual machine creation\/deployment. If these resources are not created in the template then it will check for the presence of these resources in the current subscription. If they are not present the template will not get deployed and will error out.\r\n - Next are various **properties** to configure the Virtual machine, like hardware profile, os profile, storage profile, os disk, network profile, diagnostics profile etc.\r\n - Next, we have additional **sub-resources**. These are Azure resources which will be created and linked to the current resource. Only one sub-resource is created in the above example which is an extension for VM diagnostics settings.\r\n\r\nThat's all there is to Resources in ARM Templates.

These variables can then be reused at multiple locations in the resources section. If you later want to change the value of a variable then it automatically gets updated at all other locations. They can be used to define a resource property.\r\n\r\n### Defining Variables ###\r\n\r\nVariable is a one huge JSON object. Each property can be one of the simple data type (like integer, bool, string etc.) or can be another complex JSON object. The general structure is as shown below:\r\n\r\n    \"variables\": {\r\n          \"variable 1\" : \"value 1\",\r\n          \"variable 2\" : \"value 2\",\r\n          \"variable 3\" : 1024,\r\n          \"variable 4\" : {}\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNote that in the above example, the first 3 variables are of simple value type. The 4rth variable is however of a complex JSON object type.\r\n\r\nLet's now check a real variables section from an actual ARM template:\r\n\r\n    \"variables\": {\r\n            \"vmSize\": \"Standard_A2\",\r\n            \"virtualNetworkName\": \"MyVNETName\",\r\n            \"vnetId1\": \"[resourceId('Microsoft.Network\/virtualNetworks', variables('virtualNetworkName'))]\",\r\n            \"vnetId2\": \"[resourceId(parameters('vNetRG'),'Microsoft.Network\/virtualNetworks',parameters('virtualNetworkName'))]\",\r\n            \"subnetRef\": \"[concat(variables('vnetId'), '\/subnets\/', variables('subnetName'))]\",\r\n            \"vhdStorageName\": \"[concat('vhdstorage', uniqueString(resourceGroup().id))]\",\r\n            \"storageAccountResourceGroup\": \"[resourcegroup().name]\",\r\n            \"location\": \"[resourceGroup().location]\",\r\n            \"subscriptionId\": \"[subscription().subscriptionId]\"\r\n        }\r\n\r\nThere are lots of key constructs in the above code snippet. I have tried to capture as many different constructs in this snippets as I could. Let us decode each variable one by one.\r\n\r\n 1. vmSize - Simple String\r\n 2. virtualNetworkName - Simple string name\r\n 3. vnetId1 - This uses a special function named \"**resourceId**\" to find out the resource ID of the virtual network. This function is invoked by using the syntax `\"[resourceId(Input)]\"` .  This gets the resource ID of a resource which is defined by the Input to this. Also, note the use of another variable as an input to this.\r\n 4. vnetId2 - This also fetches the resource Id of a virtual network using \"resourceId\" method. Note the use of the value of a parameter in this to find out Resource Group of the existing Virtual network (parameter \"vNetRG\").\r\n 5. subnetRef - This variable uses another function \"**concat**\" in ARM template i.e. `\"[concat(input1,input2,...)]\"`. This function can take many inputs and will concatinate (i.e. club together) the value of all the inputs provided. You can use parameters or another variable.\r\n 6. vhdStorageName - This also uses concat function to dynamically generate a storage name. However it uses \"**resourcegroup**\" function as `\"[resourcegroup()]\"`. This function always returns the resource group to which you are deploying the current ARM template. Then the variable uses the id property of the resource group returned.\r\n 7. storageAccountResourceGroup - This uses the \"name\" property of the current resource group\r\n 8. location - This uses the \"location\" property of the current resource group.\r\n 9. subscriptionId - This uses the \"**subscription**\" function as `\"[subscription()]\"` to find out the current subscription to which the current ARM template is being deployed.  Then it uses the subscription Id property of the subscription to get the required Id.\r\n\r\nNote that these constructs are very powerfull and can be used to dynamically construct your ARM template. These constructs are also known as Helper Functions and are explained in detail here: [Step by Step ARM Templates - Helper Functions](..\/step-by-step-arm-templates-helper-functions\/)\r\n\r\n### Using Variables ###\r\n\r\nUsing variables is very easy and is similar to using parameters. In fact, you already saw the usage of variables above, while defining other variables.\r\n\r\nYou use the square parenthesis to indicate to the ARM engine to evaluate whatever is inside the parenthesis. You use the \"variable\" keyword and then you pass the name of the variable as input. Check the example below.\r\n\r\n    \"storageAccountName\": \"[variables('storageAccountName')]\"\r\n\r\n### Best Practices ###\r\n\r\nBest practices are similar to the Parameters.\r\n\r\n - Provide complete descriptive names, no matter how long.\r\n - Use **Pascal Casing** to name your parameters. i.e. First letter should be a small letter. Then every new word will have the first letter as a capital. No space between words. E.g. storageAccountName\r\n - Use the constructs explained in the previous section to dynamically generate variables. This reduces any human errors.\r\n - Anything that is used more than once and is not required to be entered by an end user, should be created as a variable. Later on, this helps by minimizing the number of places you need to change the value.\r\n\r\nThat's all there is to Variables in ARM Templates.

[Understanding all components](..\/step-by-step-arm-templates-what-is-in-an-arm-template-understanding-all-components\/)\r\n 2. [Parameters - This blog post](..\/step-by-step-arm-templates-what-is-in-an-arm-template-understanding-components-2-parameters\/)\r\n 3. [Variables](..\/step-by-step-arm-templates-what-is-in-an-arm-template-understanding-components-3-variables\/)\r\n 4. [Resources](..\/step-by-step-arm-templates-what-is-in-an-arm-template-understanding-components-4-resources\/)\r\n 5. [Outputs](..\/step-by-step-arm-templates-what-is-in-an-arm-template-understanding-components-5-outputs\/)\r\n\r\n## Parameters ##\r\nAs mentioned earlier, parameters are the way to customize the templates, each time you deploy it to create resources in Azure. These parameters are the end-user inputs for various aspects of the template. E.g. If you are deploying an Azure Virtual Machine via an ARM Template then the name of the VM can be an input parameter. Operating System type can be another parameter.\r\n\r\nThe parameters can be referred and used in other parts of the ARM Template.\r\n\r\n### 1. Defining Parameters ###\r\nParameters is a one huge JSON object with multiple JSON properties. Each property is one parameter which is represented as another JSON object. Let us look at its structure at a high level.\r\n\r\n    \"parameters\": {\r\n                   \"parameter 1\" : {},\r\n                   \"parameter 2\" : {},\r\n                   \"parameter 3\" : {}\r\n    }\r\n\r\nE.g. If you are creating a template to deploy a Windows Virtual Machine then the parameters will look something like below:\r\n\r\n    \"parameters\": {\r\n                   \"VMName\" : {},\r\n                   \"AdminUserName\" : {},\r\n                   \"AdminPassword\" : {},\r\n                   \"WindowsOSVersion\" : {}\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNow let us look at one of the parameters. E.g. The AdminUserName parameter will look like:\r\n\r\n    \"adminUsername\": {\r\n                \"type\": \"string\",\r\n                \"minLength\": 1,\r\n                \"metadata\": {\r\n                    \"description\": \"Username for the Virtual Machine.\"\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n\r\nThe parameter object, as shown above, has following parts:\r\n 1. **Type** - This is the data Type of the parameter.\r\n 2. **minLength** - This is the minimum length the parameter must have\r\n 3. **Metadata** - This is just to provide a description as to what the parameter means.\r\n\r\nThe **Data Type** allowed for the parameter are:\r\n\r\n - string or secureString \u2013 any valid JSON string\r\n - int \u2013 any valid JSON integer\r\n - bool \u2013 any valid JSON boolean \r\n - object \u2013 any valid JSON object \r\n - array \u2013 any valid JSON array\r\n\r\nA more complex parameter e.g. Windows OS Version, with few more properties, is shown below:\r\n\r\n    \"windowsOSVersion\": {\r\n                \"type\": \"string\",\r\n                \"defaultValue\": \"2012-R2-Datacenter\",\r\n                \"allowedValues\": [\r\n                    \"2008-R2-SP1\",\r\n                    \"2012-Datacenter\",\r\n                    \"2012-R2-Datacenter\"\r\n                ],\r\n                \"metadata\": {\r\n                    \"description\": \"The Windows version for the VM. This will pick a fully patched image of this given Windows version. Allowed values: 2008-R2-SP1, 2012-Datacenter, 2012-R2-Datacenter.\"\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n\r\nIt has additional below properties:\r\n\r\n 1. **Default Value** - This is the default value. End User will be able to change this value when deploying the template. If no value is provided then this value is picked.\r\n 2. **Allowed Values** - This is an Array of values which are allowed for the parameter. Only value from this set is allowed as an input.\r\n\r\n### 2. Using Parameters ###\r\n\r\nUsing parameters is easy. Wherever in your template (in variables or resources section) you want to use the value of a parameter, just use the parameter function as shown below with the name of the parameter as input, enclosed in square brackets. \r\n\r\n    [parameters('windowsOSVersion')]\r\n\r\nIf the parameter value is assigned to a property, enclosing it in double quotes, as shown below:\r\n\r\n    \"sku\": \"[parameters('windowsOSVersion')]\"\r\n\r\n### 3. Best Practices ###\r\n\r\n - Try to always provide Default Values\r\n - Provide metadata so that you can provide insight as to what the parameter is meant for\r\n - Provide complete descriptive names, no matter how long.\r\n - Use **Pascal Casing** to name your parameters. i.e. First letter should be a small letter. Then every new word will have the first letter as a capital. No space between words. E.g. windowsOSVersion\r\n - Use properties like minLength and Allowed values to impose restrictions. This reduces any human errors.\r\n\r\nThat's all there is to Parameters in ARM Templates. If you have any doubts, please comment in the below section.

It also defines the dependencies between the deployed resources.\r\n\r\nIn this post, we will deconstruct any basic ARM template and will understand it's various components.\r\n\r\nAny ARM Template will look like below:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n        \"$schema\": \"https:\/\/schema.management.azure.com\/schemas\/2015-01-01\/deploymentTemplate.json#\",\r\n        \"contentVersion\": \"1.0.0.0\",\r\n        \"parameters\": {},\r\n        \"variables\": {},\r\n        \"resources\": [ {}, {} ]\r\n    }\r\n\r\nSnapshot of the Template at root level, as generated via Visual Studio:\r\n\r\n![ARM Template Components][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs you can see the components (or properties) of any ARM template includes:\r\n\r\n 1.

To understand ARM templates, you need to understand few quick basics about JSON. These will enable you to lay a great foundation which will enable you to understand ARM templates very easily.\r\n\r\nJSON or JavaScript Object Notation (pronounce like \"Jay-son\") is a text-based data format that's designed to be human-readable, lightweight, and easy to transmit between a server and a web client. Its syntax is derived from JavaScript. Think of this as an even more compact version of XML files.\r\n\r\nJSON is a popular notation for transmitting data through RESTful web services. The official internet media type for JSON is `application\/json`, and JSON files typically have a `.json` extension.\r\n\r\nTo understand JSON we need to understand **3 main components**. These components are like building blocks, using which you can build very complex JSON files.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 1. Objects ##\r\n\r\nObjects are the heart of JSON. Object denotes a real life object, e.g. an Employee. Just like a real life object, these have various properties and a value for each of these properties. E.g. An Employee will have Name property with value as John. Further, an employee object can have various another properties like Age, Salary, Department etc. So to denote an object in JSON you:\r\n\r\n - One object will be represented by curly brackets. It will begin from opening curly bracket i.e. `{` and will end at closing curly bracket i.e. `}`\r\n - Denote the property and corresponding values as `\"key\" : \"value\"` or `\"property\" : \"value\"` pairs.\r\n - You can only use double quotes for Properties as they will always be of type string\r\n - You will have double quotes around Values if they are of string type. You will not have any quotes in case of a number or a boolean value.\r\n - Each property will be separated from next property by a comma\r\n\r\n**Note:** Each JSON file is also a single JSON object. At root level it starts with an opening curly bracket i.e. `{` and will end with closing curly bracket i.e. `}`. There can't be any other objects at the root level. Think of this similar to how in an XML file there can be only one element at the root level. \r\n\r\nExample Employee object is shown below:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n        \"Name\" : \"John\",\r\n        \"Age\" : 34,\r\n        \"Department\" : \"Finance\",\r\n        \"Salary\" : \"100000\",\r\n        \"IsAdmin\" : true\r\n    }\r\n\r\n## 2. Arrays ##\r\n\r\nSimply put, arrays are a collection of items. In JSON the **square brackets** represents an Array. E.g. An array of 3 employees will look like below:\r\n\r\n    [\r\n      {\r\n            \"Name\" : \"John\",\r\n            \"Age\" : 34\r\n        },\r\n       {\r\n            \"Name\" : \"Mary\",\r\n            \"Age\" : 32\r\n        },\r\n       {\r\n            \"Name\" : \"Matthew\",\r\n            \"Age\" : 29\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n\r\n## 3. Nesting of Objects ##\r\nNow things get more interesting with nesting of Objects. What Nesting means is that one object can have it's property as another complex object. Don't worry if that sounds confusing. Let's understand that statement using an example. An Address where a person lives can be represented by an object. This object will look like below:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      \"StreetNumber\" : \"50\",\r\n      \"StreetName\" : \"Brian Harrison Way\",\r\n      \"Unit Number\" : 22,\r\n      \"City\" : \"Toronto\",\r\n      \"Country\" : \"Canada\"\r\n    }\r\nNow an Employee Object will have an Address object as one of it's property (because employee need to live somewhere). This new complex Employee object will look like below, with nested Address object as one of it's property:\r\n\r\n     {\r\n            \"Name\" : \"John\",\r\n            \"Age\" : 34,\r\n            \"Department\" : \"Finance\",\r\n            \"Salary\" : \"100000\",\r\n            \"IsAdmin\" : true,\r\n            \"Address\" :   {\r\n                              \"StreetNumber\" : \"50\",\r\n                              \"StreetName\" : \"Brian Harrison Way\",\r\n                              \"Unit Number\" : 22,\r\n                              \"City\" : \"Toronto\",\r\n                              \"Country\" : \"Canada\"\r\n                           }\r\n        }\r\n\r\nThat's all there is to it. Now you can use these 3 components and build very complex json files\/templates. Even the most complex template can be broken into these 3 components. \r\n\r\nBelow is a complex example with all 3 components. \r\n\r\n    {\r\n        \"Department\": \"Finance\",\r\n        \"TotalEmployees\": 2,\r\n        \"Employees\": [\r\n            {\r\n                \"Name\": \"John\",\r\n                \"Age\": 34,\r\n                \"Department\": \"Finance\",\r\n                \"Salary\": \"100000\",\r\n                \"IsAdmin\": true,\r\n                \"Address\": {\r\n                    \"StreetNumber\": \"50\",\r\n                    \"StreetName\": \"Brian Harrison Way\",\r\n                    \"Unit Number\": 22,\r\n                    \"City\": \"Toronto\",\r\n                    \"Country\": \"Canada\"\r\n                }\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                \"Name\": \"John\",\r\n                \"Age\": 34,\r\n                \"Department\": \"Finance\",\r\n                \"Salary\": \"100000\",\r\n                \"IsAdmin\": true,\r\n                \"Address\": {\r\n                    \"StreetNumber\": \"50\",\r\n                    \"StreetName\": \"Brian Harrison Way\",\r\n                    \"Unit Number\": 22,\r\n                    \"City\": \"Toronto\",\r\n                    \"Country\": \"Canada\"\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        ]\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe above JSON object denotes one department with name as Finance and total number of employees as 2. Then the \"Employees\" object is an array of 2 emplyees. Each emplyee object further have a complex property as Address, which is another object. \r\n\r\nIf you understood each of the 3 components, you should be able to build\/understand most complex JSON files with ease.",

The environment was managed by Third Party who did not want to give any service account for VMWare as their environment was shared with different customers. So we had access only to the VMs. Without relevant access, ASR for VMWare was out of the question for us.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nWe treated the VMs, in such environment, as physical machines when setting up ASR to replicate these machines to Azure. \r\nWe used the option of \"***Not virtualized\/other***\" in the \"***Prepare Infrastructure***\" wizard of ASR. We **treated the VMs as physical servers** and did not face any issues during the migration. \r\n\r\nRefer below screenshot for the exact option discussed above.\r\n\r\n![Protection Goal][1]\r\n\r\n\r\nLater when enabling the Replication for any Server, run the \"***Enable Replication***\" wizard by clicking on \"**+Replicate**\" on the ASR vault's blade. Then select \"**Machine Type**\" as \"***Physical Machine***\" and add the Physical Machines by mentioning their IP addresses. \r\n\r\n**Note:** For this approach to work, the Configuration server should be on the same network as the VM being considered as Physical Machine.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe were able to migrate many servers successfully and without any issues using this approach.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https:\/\/HarvestingClouds.com\/images\/14696297155798c513ea908.png",

		"category": "Azure",
		"body": "**Azure blob storage** can provide a very highly available way to store your files in the cloud. You can dynamically add or remove the files in an automated fashion. These files can then be used for any number of purposes. E.g. A parameter file for ARM template can be kept in Azure blob storage and then dynamically read while creating resources from an ARM template.\r\n\r\n**The whole process can be broken down into 3 parts**:\r\n\r\n 1. Generating the context to the storage container\r\n 2. Uploading the files using the context\r\n 3. Downloading the files using the context\r\n\r\n### 1. Generating the context to the storage container\r\nThe context to the storage blob container can be created in one of the 3 ways, based on your security requirements. All methods use the `New-AzureStorageContext` cmdlet to generate the storage context. The methods differ on how you pass the parameters to this cmdlet.\r\n\r\n**A. Via fetching the Azure Storage Key**\r\n\r\nThis first method uses the `Get-AzureStorageKey` to fetch the storage key. This key is then used to generate the context as shown below.\r\n\r\n    $StorageAccountName = \"yourstorageaccount\"\r\n    $StorageAccountKey = Get-AzureStorageKey -StorageAccountName $StorageAccountName\r\n    $Ctx = New-AzureStorageContext $StorageAccountName -StorageAccountKey $StorageAccountKey.Primary\r\n\r\n**B. Via fetching the Azure Storage Container SAS Token**\r\n\r\nThis second method uses the `New-AzureStorageContainerSASToken` to create a new SAS token to securely access the storage container. This token is then used to generate the context as shown below.\r\n\r\n    $sasToken = New-AzureStorageContainerSASToken -Container abc -Permission rl\r\n    $Ctx = New-AzureStorageContext -StorageAccountName $StorageAccountName -SasToken $sasToken\r\n\r\n**C. Via Connectin String**\r\n\r\nThis third method uses a connection string, entered manually, which is then used to generate the context as shown below.\r\n\r\n    $ConnectionString = \"DefaultEndpointsProtocol=http;BlobEndpoint=<blobEndpoint>;QueueEndpoint=<QueueEndpoint>;TableEndpoint=<TableEndpoint>;AccountName=<AccountName>;AccountKey=<AccountKey>\"\r\n    $Ctx = New-AzureStorageContext -ConnectionString $ConnectionString\r\n\r\n### 2. Uploading the files using the context\r\n\r\nNow that you have the context to the storage account you can upload and download files from the storage blob container.\r\nUse the below code to upload a file named \"_Parameters.json_\", located on the local machine at \"_C:\\Temp_\" directory.\r\n\r\n    #Uploading File\r\n    $BlobName = \"Parameters.json\"\r\n    $localFile = \"C:\\Temp\\\" + $BlobName\r\n    $ContainerName  = \"vhds\"\r\n\r\n    #Note the Force switch will overwrite if the file already exists in the Azure container\r\n    Set-AzureStorageBlobContent -File $localFile -Container $ContainerName -Blob $BlobName -Context $Ctx -Force\r\n\r\n### 3. Downloading the files using the context\r\n\r\nDownload works in almost identical manner. You use the Get cmdlet instead of Set as shown below to download a file to a local folder, located at \"_C:\\Downloads_\".\r\n\r\n    #Download File\r\n    $BlobName = \"Parameters.json\"\r\n    $localTargetDirectory = \"C:\\Downloads\"\r\n    $ContainerName  = \"vhds\"\r\n\r\n    Get-AzureStorageBlobContent -Blob $BlobName -Container $ContainerName -Destination $localTargetDirectory -Context $ctx\r\n\r\nI hope this helps simplify the automated usage of Azure Storage container. Let us know your concerns or questions if any.\r\n\r\nYou can find the **complete sample** at the below link on GitHub.

Pull Mode\r\n 3. Hybrid Mode (i.e. combination of Push and Pull)\r\n \r\n### Configuration for the PUSH Mode\r\n\r\nYou need to follow three steps to configure Partial configurations for the PUSH mode:\r\n\r\n - Configure the LCM, on the target node, to expect partial configurations\r\n - Push each partial configuration from different sources using **Publish-DSCConfiguration** cmdlet. Target node will automatically combine the partial configurations into single configuration.\r\n - Apply the configuration by calling the **Start-DSCConfiguration**cmdlet\r\n \r\n### Configuration for the PULL Mode\r\n\r\nThis is bit complex than the Push mode. In nutshell you only need couple of steps:\r\n\r\n - Configure the LCM, on the target node, to receive partial configurations but from PULL servers\r\n - Name and locate the configuration documents properly on the pull servers\r\n \r\nTo know more about DSC Partial configurations follow the below references:\r\n\r\n   - [Detailed Blog by AutomationNext with very valuable insights](https:\/\/automationnext.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/19\/powershell-desired-state-configuration-partial-configurations-without-configurationid\/)\r\n   - [Official MSDN Article](https:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/en-us\/powershell\/dsc\/partialconfigs)",
