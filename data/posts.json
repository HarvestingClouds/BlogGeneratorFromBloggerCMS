		"body": "**Azure blob storage** can provide a very highly available way to store your files in the cloud. You can dynamically add or remove the files in an automated fashion. These files can then be used for any number of purposes. E.g. A parameter file for ARM template can be kept in Azure blob storage and then dynamically read while creating resources from an ARM template.\r\n\r\n**The whole process can be broken down into 3 parts**:\r\n\r\n 1. Generating the context to the storage container\r\n 2. Uploading the files using the context\r\n 3. Downloading the files using the context\r\n\r\n### 1. Generating the context to the storage container\r\nThe context to the storage blob container can be created in one of the 3 ways, based on your security requirements. All methods use the `New-AzureStorageContext` cmdlet to generate the storage context. The methods differ on how you pass the parameters to this cmdlet.\r\n\r\n**A. Via fetching the Azure Storage Key**\r\n\r\nThis first method uses the `Get-AzureStorageKey` to fetch the storage key. This key is then used to generate the context as shown below.\r\n\r\n    $StorageAccountName = \"yourstorageaccount\"\r\n    $StorageAccountKey = Get-AzureStorageKey -StorageAccountName $StorageAccountName\r\n    $Ctx = New-AzureStorageContext $StorageAccountName -StorageAccountKey $StorageAccountKey.Primary\r\n\r\n**B. Via fetching the Azure Storage Container SAS Token**\r\n\r\nThis second method uses the `New-AzureStorageContainerSASToken` to create a new SAS token to securely access the storage container. This token is then used to generate the context as shown below.\r\n\r\n    $sasToken = New-AzureStorageContainerSASToken -Container abc -Permission rl\r\n    $Ctx = New-AzureStorageContext -StorageAccountName $StorageAccountName -SasToken $sasToken\r\n\r\n**C. Via Connectin String**\r\n\r\nThis third method uses a connection string, entered manually, which is then used to generate the context as shown below.\r\n\r\n    $ConnectionString = \"DefaultEndpointsProtocol=http;BlobEndpoint=<blobEndpoint>;QueueEndpoint=<QueueEndpoint>;TableEndpoint=<TableEndpoint>;AccountName=<AccountName>;AccountKey=<AccountKey>\"\r\n    $Ctx = New-AzureStorageContext -ConnectionString $ConnectionString\r\n\r\n### 2. Uploading the files using the context\r\n\r\nNow that you have the context to the storage account you can upload and download files from the storage blob container.\r\nUse the below code to upload a file named \"_Parameters.json_\", located on the local machine at \"_C:\\Temp_\" directory.\r\n\r\n    #Uploading File\r\n    $BlobName = \"Parameters.json\"\r\n    $localFile = \"C:\\Temp\\\" + $BlobName\r\n\r\n    #Note the Force switch will overwrite if the file already exists in the Azure container\r\n    Set-AzureStorageBlobContent -File $localFile -Container $ContainerName -Blob $BlobName -Context $Ctx -Force\r\n\r\n### 3. Downloading the files using the context\r\n\r\nDownload works in almost identical manner. You use the Get cmdlet instead of Set as shown below to download a file to a local folder, located at \"_C:\\Downloads_\".\r\n\r\n    #Download File\r\n    $BlobName = \"Parameters.json\"\r\n    $localTargetDirectory = \"C:\\Downloads\"\r\n\r\n    Get-AzureStorageBlobContent -Blob $BlobName -Container $ContainerName -Destination $localTargetDirectory -Context $ctx\r\n\r\nI hope this helps simplify the automated usage of Azure Storage container. Let us know your concerns or questions if any.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Reference:** <a href=\"https:\/\/azure.microsoft.com\/en-us\/documentation\/articles\/storage-powershell-guide-full\/\" target=\"_blank\">Using Azure PowerShell with Azure Storage<\/a>",

In general, any data which lives for a longer period of time and is accessed less than once a month is a perfect candidate for cool storage.\u201d It is similar to what **Glacier storage tier** provides in Amazon Web Services.\r\n\r\n - **Pricing:** Its cost is as low as $0.01\/GB.\r\n - **Availability:** 99% (as compared to 99.9% for Hot Storage). With Read-access geo-redundant storage (or RA-GRS) the SLA is 99.9% (as compared to 99.99% for Hot).\r\n - **Deciding which AccessTier to use:** If the objects in the storage account will be more frequently accessed, then go with **Hot Tier**.

I have solved this by altering the code and updating the custom widget.\r\n**Note:** The WithMultipleFilters() option will not help you in this. That option enables multiple filters on different columns. To have multiple filters in the same column you need to update the way filtering works in the tool itself.\r\n\r\nI have used a list of checkboxes and any or all of the elements selected in this checkbox list will be used for filtering the column values.\r\n\r\nYou can find the code in my fork of the official Grid.Mvc repo at below link:\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/HarvestingClouds\/Grid.Mvc\" target=\"_blank\">Fork of Grid.Mvc repo with Advance Filters<\/a>\r\n\r\nI have also created a pull request for the same so that more people get benefit from this if they refer the master branch of the main repo.\r\n\r\n### What are the changes I have done?\r\nI have made changes to two files:\r\n\r\n 1. **DefaultColumnFilter.cs** file in \"**GridMvc**\" class library project under the Filters folder. I have updated the GetFilterExpression method to create multiple expressions based on the pipeline character in filter values.\r\n 2. **gridmvc.customwidgets.js** file in \"**GridMvc.Site**\" web application project\r\n\r\nBoth of these paths are shown below:\r\nLocation of DefaultColumnFilter.cs:\r\n![DefaultColumnFilter.cs](http:\/\/HarvestingClouds.com\/images\/146173541957204ffb99678.png \"DefaultColumnFilter.cs\")\r\n\r\nLocation of gridmvc.customwidgets.js:\r\n![gridmvc.customwidgets.js](http:\/\/HarvestingClouds.com\/images\/146173543057205006529e6.png \"gridmvc.customwidgets.js\")\r\n\r\nHow the end result look like:\r\n![Checkbox Filtering](http:\/\/HarvestingClouds.com\/images\/14617354255720500171fe7.png \"Checkbox Filtering\")\r\n\r\nYou can directly use the code if you want.

		"body": "Azure Site Recovery or ASR is now available in the new Azure Resource Manager or ARM portal (codename Ibiza) with modern user interface. It is in preview at this stage. But it is production ready for all the Hyper-V related scenarios.\r\n**Your older Vaults (created via Classic ASM Azure Portal) will not be available in ASR preview feature.**\r\n\r\n### What are the new features\r\n\r\nThe new features include:\r\n\r\n* All the goodness of Azure Resource Manager in ASR\r\n* Lean experience for various ASR scenarios\r\n* Enhancements to the specific Site Recovery scenarios\r\n\r\n### Lets take a quick look at some of these.\r\n\r\nIf you Browse and search for \"Recovery\" you get Recovery Services Vaults as Preview feature.\r\n![Browse and Search](http:\/\/HarvestingClouds.com\/images\/14617358075720517f78904.png \"Browse and Search\")\r\n\r\nClicking on it will open up the blade for \"Recovery Services valuts\". Notice that Microsoft has PREVIEW text in this.\r\n![alt text](http:\/\/HarvestingClouds.com\/images\/1461735702572051161683f.png \"ASR Vault\")\r\n\r\nClicking on the Add button brings up the ASR vault creation blade. Notice the locations available for vault creation here.\r\n![Vault Creation](http:\/\/HarvestingClouds.com\/images\/14617359385720520210878.png \"Vault Creation\")\r\n\r\nAfter you hit create the Vault gets deployed really quickly. I tested for East US location and it was created in under 10 secs.\r\nRefresh to view your newly created vault. Click on it to open the NEW ASR Vault features. Notice that the Backup feature is also there in the ASR vault now.\r\n![New Vault](http:\/\/HarvestingClouds.com\/images\/1461735907572051e31549a.png \"New Vault\")\r\n\r\nTo find the options for replication go to Settings -> Getting Started section -> Site Recovery -> Follow Wizard.\r\n![New Site Recovery Wizard](http:\/\/HarvestingClouds.com\/images\/1461735869572051bd2d6fa.png \"New Site Recovery Wizard\")\r\n\r\nThe Scenario Types available are only two. But all the scenarios are covered here:\r\n\r\n* From my site to Azure\r\n* From my site to another site\r\n\r\nBased on the scenario you select you are asked for different options. The options for Virtualization\/Management Server type for \"From my site to Azure\" are:\r\n\r\n* VMM\r\n* Stand alone Hyper-V hosts\r\n* vCenter\r\n* Physical machines (not virtualized)\r\n![Creation Options](http:\/\/HarvestingClouds.com\/images\/14617358385720519e578ba.png \"Creation Options\")\r\n\r\n### Backup in ASR vault\r\nAnother feature is creation of Backups from the same vault. Click on the + icon for Backup in the Vault main blade and then follow the wizard for the preview feature.\r\n![Backup In ASR](http:\/\/HarvestingClouds.com\/images\/14617357575720514d5d1d8.png \"Backup In ASR\")\r\nNotice in the screenshot above that the backup types available are:\r\n\r\n* Azure virtual machine backup\r\n* File Folder backup\r\n* System Center Data Protection Manager\r\n\r\nSelecting each option provides you with details for next steps. You can then create a backup policy and configure Items to backup.\r\n\r\nGive these features a try and let us know in comments below how you find the new features.\r\nHappy Exploring!",
